<h2><span class="lsp2">PREFACE.</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">The character and credit of the British Army must
chiefly depend upon the zeal and ardour by which
all who enter into its service are animated, and
consequently it is of the highest importance that any
measure calculated to excite the spirit of emulation,
by which alone great and gallant actions are achieved,
should be adopted.</p>

<p>Nothing can more fully tend to the accomplishment
of this desirable object than a full display of the noble
deeds with which the Military History of our country
abounds. To hold forth these bright examples to
the imitation of the youthful soldier, and thus to
incite him to emulate the meritorious conduct of those
who have preceded him in their honorable career,
are among the motives that have given rise to the
present publication.</p>

<p>The operations of the British Troops are, indeed,
announced in the "London Gazette," from whence
they are transferred into the public prints: the
achievements of our armies are thus made known at
the time of their occurrence, and receive the tribute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
of praise and admiration to which they are entitled.
On extraordinary occasions, the Houses of Parliament
have been in the habit of conferring on the Commanders,
and the Officers and Troops acting under
their orders, expressions of approbation and of thanks
for their skill and bravery; and these testimonials,
confirmed by the high honour of their Sovereign's
approbation, constitute the reward which the soldier
most highly prizes.</p>

<p>It has not, however, until late years, been the practice
(which appears to have long prevailed in some of
the Continental armies) for British Regiments to keep
regular records of their services and achievements.
Hence some difficulty has been experienced in obtaining,
particularly from the old Regiments, an authentic
account of their origin and subsequent services.</p>

<p>This defect will now be remedied, in consequence
of His Majesty having been pleased to command
that every Regiment shall, in future, keep a full and
ample record of its services at home and abroad.</p>

<p>From the materials thus collected, the country
will henceforth derive information as to the difficulties
and privations which chequer the career of those who
embrace the military profession. In Great Britain,
where so large a number of persons are devoted to
the active concerns of agriculture, manufactures,
and commerce, and where these pursuits have, for so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>
long a period, being undisturbed by the <em>presence of
war</em>, which few other countries have escaped, comparatively
little is known of the vicissitudes of active
service and of the casualties of climate, to which,
even during peace, the British Troops are exposed in
every part of the globe, with little or no interval of
repose.</p>

<p>In their tranquil enjoyment of the blessings which
the country derives from the industry and the enterprise
of the agriculturist and the trader, its happy
inhabitants may be supposed not often to reflect on
the perilous duties of the soldier and the sailor,&mdash;on
their sufferings,&mdash;and on the sacrifice of valuable life,
by which so many national benefits are obtained and
preserved.</p>

<p>The conduct of the British Troops, their valour,
and endurance, have shone conspicuously under great
and trying difficulties; and their character has been
established in Continental warfare by the irresistible
spirit with which they have effected debarkations in
spite of the most formidable opposition, and by the
gallantry and steadiness with which they have maintained
their advantages against superior numbers.</p>

<p>In the official Reports made by the respective Commanders,
ample justice has generally been done to
the gallant exertions of the Corps employed; but
the details of their services and of acts of individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
bravery can only be fully given in the Annals of the
various Regiments.</p>

<p>These Records are now preparing for publication,
under his Majesty's special authority, by Mr.
<span class="smcap">Richard Cannon</span>, Principal Clerk of the Adjutant
General's Office; and while the perusal of them cannot
fail to be useful and interesting to military men
of every rank, it is considered that they will also
afford entertainment and information to the general
reader, particularly to those who may have served in
the Army, or who have relatives in the Service.</p>

<p>There exists in the breasts of most of those who
have served, or are serving, in the Army, an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Esprit
de Corps</i>&mdash;an attachment to everything belonging
to their Regiment; to such persons a narrative of
the services of their own Corps cannot fail to prove
interesting. Authentic accounts of the actions of
the great, the valiant, the loyal, have always been
of paramount interest with a brave and civilized
people. Great Britain has produced a race of heroes
who, in moments of danger and terror, have stood
"firm as the rocks of their native shore:" and when
half the world has been arrayed against them, they
have fought the battles of their Country with unshaken
fortitude. It is presumed that a record of
achievements in war,&mdash;victories so complete and surprising,
gained by our countrymen, our brothers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
our fellow citizens in arms,&mdash;a record which revives
the memory of the brave, and brings their gallant
deeds before us,&mdash;will certainly prove acceptable to
the public.</p>

<p>Biographical Memoirs of the Colonels and other
distinguished Officers will be introduced in the
Records of their respective Regiments, and the
Honorary Distinctions which have, from time to
time, been conferred upon each Regiment, as testifying
the value and importance of its services, will be
faithfully set forth.</p>

<p>As a convenient mode of Publication, the Record
of each Regiment will be printed in a distinct number,
so that when the whole shall be completed, the
Parts may be bound up in numerical succession.</p>

<hr class="r20a" />

<p class="p2 noindent">The natives of Britain have, at all periods, been
celebrated for innate courage and unshaken firmness,
and the national superiority of the British troops
over those of other countries has been evinced in
the midst of the most imminent perils. History contains
so many proofs of extraordinary acts of bravery,
that no doubts can be raised upon the facts which
are recorded. It must therefore be admitted, that
the distinguishing feature of the British soldier is
<span class="smcap">Intrepidity</span>. This quality was evinced by the
inhabitants of England when their country was
invaded by Julius Cæsar with a Roman army, on
which occasion the undaunted Britons rushed into
the sea to attack the Roman soldiers as they descended
from their ships; and, although their discipline
and arms were inferior to those of their
adversaries, yet their fierce and dauntless bearing
intimidated the flower of the Roman troops, including
Cæsar's favourite tenth legion. Their arms
consisted of spears, short swords, and other weapons
of rude construction. They had chariots, to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
axles of which were fastened sharp pieces of iron
resembling scythe-blades, and infantry in long
chariots resembling waggons, who alighted and
fought on foot, and for change of ground, pursuit
or retreat, sprang into the chariot and drove off
with the speed of cavalry. These inventions were,
however, unavailing against Cæsar's legions: in
the course of time a military system, with discipline
and subordination, was introduced, and
British courage, being thus regulated, was exerted
to the greatest advantage; a full development of
the national character followed, and it shone forth
in all its native brilliancy.</p>

<p>The military force of the Anglo-Saxons consisted
principally of infantry: Thanes, and other men of
property, however, fought on horseback. The
infantry were of two classes, heavy and light.
The former carried large shields armed with spikes,
long broad swords and spears; and the latter were
armed with swords or spears only. They had also
men armed with clubs, others with battle-axes and
javelins.</p>

<p>The feudal troops established by William the
Conqueror consisted (as already stated in the Introduction
to the Cavalry) almost entirely of horse;
but when the warlike barons and knights, with their
trains of tenants and vassals, took the field, a proportion
of men appeared on foot, and, although
these were of inferior degree, they proved stout-hearted
Britons of stanch fidelity. When stipendiary
troops were employed, infantry always constituted
a considerable portion of the military force;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
and this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">arme</i> has since acquired, in every quarter
of the globe, a celebrity never exceeded by the
armies of any nation at any period.</p>

<p>The weapons carried by the infantry, during the
several reigns succeeding the Conquest, were bows
and arrows, half-pikes, lances, halberds, various
kinds of battle-axes, swords, and daggers. Armour
was worn on the head and body, and in course of
time the practice became general for military men
to be so completely cased in steel, that it was
almost impossible to slay them.</p>

<p>The introduction of the use of gunpowder in the
destructive purposes of war, in the early part of the
fourteenth century, produced a change in the arms
and equipment of the infantry-soldier. Bows and
arrows gave place to various kinds of fire-arms, but
British archers continued formidable adversaries;
and, owing to the inconvenient construction and imperfect
bore of the fire-arms when first introduced,
a body of men, well trained in the use of the bow
from their youth, was considered a valuable acquisition
to every army, even as late as the sixteenth
century.</p>

<p>During a great part of the reign of Queen Elizabeth
each company of infantry usually consisted of
men armed five different ways; in every hundred
men forty were "<em>men-at-arms</em>," and sixty "<em>shot</em>;"
the "men-at-arms" were ten halberdiers, or battle-axe
men, and thirty pikemen; and the "shot" were
twenty archers, twenty musketeers, and twenty
harquebusiers, and each man carried, besides his
principal weapon, a sword and dagger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span></p>

<p>Companies of infantry varied at this period in
numbers from 150 to 300 men; each company had
a colour or ensign, and the mode of formation recommended
by an English military writer (Sir John
Smithe) in 1590 was:&mdash;the colour in the centre of
the company guarded by the halberdiers; the pikemen
in equal proportions, on each flank of the
halberdiers: half the musketeers on each flank of
the pikes; half the archers on each flank of the musketeers,
and the harquebusiers (whose arms were
much lighter than the muskets then in use) in equal
proportions on each flank of the company for skirmishing.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
It was customary to unite a number of companies
into one body, called a <span class="smcap">Regiment</span>, which
frequently amounted to three thousand men: but
each company continued to carry a colour. Numerous
improvements were eventually introduced in the
construction of fire-arms, and, it having been found
impossible to make armour proof against the muskets
then in use (which carried a very heavy ball) without
its being too weighty for the soldier, armour was
gradually laid aside by the infantry in the seventeenth
century: bows and arrows also fell into disuse,
and the infantry were reduced to two classes,
viz.: <em>musketeers</em>, armed with matchlock muskets,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>swords, and daggers; and <em>pikemen</em>, armed with pikes
from fourteen to eighteen feet long, and swords.</p>

<p>In the early part of the seventeenth century
Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden, reduced the
strength of regiments to 1000 men. He caused the
gunpowder, which had heretofore been carried in
flasks, or in small wooden bandoliers, each containing
a charge, to be made up into cartridges, and
carried in pouches; and he formed each regiment
into two wings of musketeers, and a centre division
of pikemen. He also adopted the practice of forming
four regiments into a brigade; and the number
of colours was afterwards reduced to three in each
regiment. He formed his columns so compactly that
his infantry could resist the charge of the celebrated
Polish horsemen and Austrian cuirassiers; and his
armies became the admiration of other nations. His
mode of formation was copied by the English,
French, and other European states; but so great
was the prejudice in favour of ancient customs, that
all his improvements were not adopted until near a
century afterwards.</p>

<p>In 1664 King Charles II. raised a corps for sea-service,
styled the Admiral's regiment. In 1678
each company of 100 men usually consisted of 30
pikemen, 60 musketeers, and 10 men armed with
light firelocks. In this year the King added a company
of men armed with hand-grenades to each of
the old British regiments, which was designated the
"grenadier company." Daggers were so contrived
as to fit in the muzzles of the muskets, and bayonets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
similar to those at present in use were adopted about
twenty years afterwards.</p>

<p>An Ordnance regiment was raised in 1685, by
order of King James II., to guard the artillery, and
was designated the Royal Fusiliers (now 7th Foot).
This corps, and the companies of grenadiers, did
not carry pikes.</p>

<p>King William III. incorporated the Admiral's
regiment in the second Foot Guards, and raised
two Marine regiments for sea-service. During the
war in this reign, each company of infantry (excepting
the fusiliers and grenadiers) consisted of 14
pikemen and 46 musketeers; the captains carried
pikes; lieutenants, partisans; ensigns, half-pikes;
and serjeants, halberds. After the peace in 1697 the
Marine regiments were disbanded, but were again
formed on the breaking out of the war in 1702.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>During the reign of Queen Anne the pikes were
laid aside, and every infantry soldier was armed
with a musket, bayonet, and sword; the grenadiers
ceased, about the same period, to carry hand grenades;
and the regiments were directed to lay aside
their third colour: the corps of Royal Artillery was
first added to the Army in this reign.</p>

<p>About the year 1745, the men of the battalion
companies of infantry ceased to carry swords; during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
the reign of George II. light companies were added
to infantry regiments; and in 1764 a Board of
General Officers recommended that the grenadiers
should lay aside their swords, as that weapon had
never been used during the Seven Years' War. Since
that period the arms of the infantry soldier have been
limited to the musket and bayonet.</p>

<p>The arms and equipment of the British Troops have
seldom differed materially, since the Conquest, from
those of other European states; and in some respects
the arming has, at certain periods, been allowed to
be inferior to that of the nations with whom they
have had to contend; yet, under this disadvantage,
the bravery and superiority of the British infantry
have been evinced on very many and most trying
occasions, and splendid victories have been gained
over very superior numbers.</p>

<p>Great Britain has produced a race of lion-like
champions who have dared to confront a host of
foes, and have proved themselves valiant with any
arms. At <em>Crecy</em> King Edward III., at the head of
about 30,000 men, defeated, on the 26th of August,
1346, Philip King of France, whose army is said to
have amounted to 100,000 men; here British valour
encountered veterans of renown:&mdash;the King of Bohemia,
the King of Majorca, and many princes and
nobles were slain, and the French army was routed
and cut to pieces. Ten years afterwards, Edward
Prince of Wales, who was designated the Black
Prince, defeated, at <em>Poictiers</em>, with 14,000 men,
a French army of 60,000 horse, besides infantry,
and took John I., King of France, and his son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
Philip, prisoners. On the 25th of October, 1415,
King Henry V., with an army of about 13,000
men, although greatly exhausted by marches, privations,
and sickness, defeated, at <em>Agincourt</em>, the
Constable of France, at the head of the flower of
the French nobility and an army said to amount to
60,000 men, and gained a complete victory.</p>

<p>During the seventy years' war between the United
Provinces of the Netherlands and the Spanish monarchy,
which commenced in 1578 and terminated
in 1648, the British infantry in the service of the
States-General were celebrated for their unconquerable
spirit and firmness;<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and in the thirty
years' war between the Protestant Princes and the
Emperor of Germany, the British Troops in the service
of Sweden and other states were celebrated for
deeds of heroism.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> In the wars of Queen Anne,
the fame of the British army under the great
<span class="smcap">Marlborough</span> was spread throughout the world;
and if we glance at the achievements performed
within the memory of persons now living, there is
abundant proof that the Britons of the present age
are not inferior to their ancestors in the qualities
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>which constitute good soldiers. Witness the deeds
of the brave men, of whom there are many now
surviving, who fought in Egypt in 1801, under the
brave Abercromby, and compelled the French army,
which had been vainly styled <em>Invincible</em>, to evacuate
that country; also the services of the gallant
Troops during the arduous campaigns in the Peninsula,
under the immortal <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>; and the
determined stand made by the British Army at
Waterloo, where Napoleon Bonaparte, who had
long been the inveterate enemy of Great Britain,
and had sought and planned her destruction by
every means he could devise, was compelled to
leave his vanquished legions to their fate, and to
place himself at the disposal of the British Government.
These achievements, with others of recent
dates in the distant climes of India, prove that the
same valour and constancy which glowed in the
breasts of the heroes of Crecy, Poictiers, Agincourt,
Blenheim, and Ramilies, continue to animate the
Britons of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>The British Soldier is distinguished for a robust
and muscular frame,&mdash;intrepidity which no danger
can appal,&mdash;unconquerable spirit and resolution,&mdash;patience
in fatigue and privation, and cheerful obedience
to his superiors. These qualities,&mdash;united with
an excellent system of order and discipline to regulate
and give a skilful direction to the energies and
adventurous spirit of the hero, and a wise selection
of officers of superior talent to command, whose
presence inspires confidence,&mdash;have been the leading
causes of the splendid victories gained by the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
arms.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The fame of the deeds of the past and
present generations in the various battle-fields where
the robust sons of Albion have fought and conquered,
surrounds the British arms with a halo of glory;
these achievements will live in the page of history to
the end of time.</p>

<p>The records of the several regiments will be found
to contain a detail of facts of an interesting character,
connected with the hardships, sufferings, and gallant
exploits of British soldiers in the various parts of the
world, where the calls of their Country and the commands
of their Sovereign have required them to
proceed in the execution of their duty, whether in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
active continental operations, or in maintaining colonial
territories in distant and unfavourable climes.</p>

<p>The superiority of the British infantry has been
pre-eminently set forth in the wars of six centuries,
and admitted by the greatest commanders which
Europe has produced. The formations and movements
of this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">arme</i>, as at present practised, while
they are adapted to every species of warfare, and to
all probable situations and circumstances of service,
are well suited to show forth the brilliancy of military
tactics calculated upon mathematical and scientific
principles. Although the movements and evolutions
have been copied from the continental armies, yet
various improvements have from time to time been
introduced, to ensure that simplicity and celerity by
which the superiority of the national military character
is maintained. The rank and influence which
Great Britain has attained among the nations of the
world have in a great measure been purchased by
the valour of the Army, and to persons who have the
welfare of their country at heart the records of the
several regiments cannot fail to prove interesting.</p>

<p>
In the General Orders issued by Lieut.-General Sir John Hope (afterwards
Lord Hopetoun), congratulating the army upon the successful result
of the Battle of Corunna, on the 16th of January, 1809, it is stated:&mdash;"On
no occasion has the undaunted valour of British troops ever been more
manifest. At the termination of a severe and harassing march, rendered
necessary by the superiority which the enemy had acquired, and
which had materially impaired the efficiency of the troops, many disadvantages
were to be encountered. These have all been surmounted by
the conduct of the troops themselves; and the enemy has been taught,
that, whatever advantages of position or of numbers he may possess, there
is inherent in the British officers and soldiers a bravery that knows not
how to yield,&mdash;that no circumstances can appal,&mdash;and that will ensure
victory, when it is to be obtained by the exertion of any human means."</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Royal Irish Regiment of Foot</span> existed many
years, as independent companies of pikemen and musketeers
on the establishment of Ireland, previous to
the formation of the regiment in 1684; several of these
companies having been in the service of the Commonwealth
in the time of Oliver Cromwell. At the Restoration
in 1660, King Charles II. disbanded the army
of the Commonwealth in England, and embodied several
new corps. Little alteration was, however, made in
the Irish forces, excepting the formation of a regiment
of foot guards, called the "Royal Regiment of Ireland,"
which, with about twenty independent troops of
horse and eighty companies of foot, constituted the
military force of Ireland. Towards the close of his
reign, King Charles II. took particular interest in
improving the organization of the military establishments
of his dominions, and the Irish independent
troops of horse were embodied into three regiments
of cavalry; at the same time the companies of foot were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
constituted seven regiments of infantry. The colonelcy
of one of these corps was conferred on <span class="smcap">Arthur Earl
of Granard</span>, by commission dated the 1st of April,
1684; it is the only one of these ten regiments which
has continued in the service of the British crown; and
it now bears the title of the <span class="smcap">Eighteenth</span>, or the <span class="smcap">Royal
Irish Regiment of Foot</span>.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1685</div>

<p>On the 6th of February, 1685, King Charles II.
died, and was succeeded by his brother, James II.;
and in June following James Duke of Monmouth
erected the standard of rebellion in the west of England,
and asserted his own pretensions to the throne.
On this occasion the <span class="smcap">Earl of Granard's</span> regiment was
ordered to proceed to England: it embarked from
Dublin, landed at Park Gate, and marched to Chester.
In a few days after its arrival in England the
rebel army was overthrown at Sedgemoor, and the
Duke of Monmouth was subsequently captured and
beheaded; when the regiment returned to Ireland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1686</div>

<p>The King, being of the Roman Catholic persuasion,
soon evinced a determination to use his utmost endeavours
to subvert the Protestant religion and the constitution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
of the kingdom; commencing in Ireland,
where the Catholics were more numerous than the Protestants.
The Earl of Clarendon was nominated Lord-Lieutenant;
but "Colonel &mdash;&mdash; Talbot, a furious Papist,
was empowered to model the army, and he dismissed
the greater part of the Protestant officers, filling
their places with those of his own religion. After
having performed this signal service, he came over
to England, where he was created Earl Tyrconnel
and lieut.-general of the Irish army."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> The Earl
of Granard, not approving of these proceedings, resigned
the colonelcy of the regiment in favour of his
son, <span class="smcap">Arthur Lord Forbes</span>, whose commission as colonel
was dated the 1st of March, 1686.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1687</div>

<p>In the summer of 1687, the regiment was encamped,
with the other Irish corps, on the Curragh of Kildare;
and the Earl Tyrconnel made a minute inspection of
every troop and company, inquiring the name of
every man, and discharging many because they were
the descendants of men who had served Oliver Cromwell.
When the regiment went into quarters, nearly
all the Protestant officers and soldiers were dismissed
from the service, a few only being retained to discipline
the recruits, and the ranks were completed with men
of the Roman Catholic religion.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Lord Forbes</span> being a spirited young
nobleman of the Protestant religion, Earl Tyrconnel
paid some deference to his Lordship, to avoid an open
collision with so chivalrous an officer; and more Protestants
were retained in <span class="smcap">Lord Forbes's</span> regiment than
in any other Irish corps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">1688</div>

<p>In the summer of 1688, the regiment was again encamped
on the Curragh of Kildare. Meanwhile the
proceedings of the Court in favour of Papacy and
arbitrary government, had alarmed the kingdom, and a
number of noblemen and gentlemen had invited the
Prince of Orange to come to England with an army
to support the Protestant interest. On this occasion
<span class="smcap">Lord Forbes's</span> regiment was ordered to proceed to
England:<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> it landed at Chester, marched to London,
and was quartered in the borough of Southwark.</p>

<p>The Prince of Orange having passed Dover with a
powerful armament, the regiment was ordered to march
to Salisbury, where it joined King James's army a few
days after the Prince had landed at Torbay, and
marched to Exeter. The English army, which amounted
to thirty thousand men, had not been remodelled
as the Irish forces had been, but consisted principally
of Protestant officers and soldiers, who refused to fight
in the cause of Papacy and arbitrary government, and
many of them joined the Prince of Orange. Under
these circumstances, the King ordered the army to
withdraw towards London, and <span class="smcap">Lord Forbes's</span> regiment
marched to Colnbrook, where it was quartered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
when King James attempted to escape to France
Lord Forbes waited on the Prince of Orange, who
directed him to disband the Roman Catholic officers and
soldiers, and to keep the Protestants to their colours:
upwards of five hundred officers and soldiers were
dismissed, and about two hundred Protestants, of all
ranks, remained with the colours.</p>

<p>In a few days after this event, a report was circulated
that the Irish soldiers had commenced murdering the
country people and setting fire to the villages in the
south of England. This proved false; but on the first
circulation of the report, Major Sir John Edgeworth,
who commanded the regiment in the absence of Colonel
Lord Forbes, who was with the Prince of Orange in
London (the Lieut.-Colonel, Lord Brittas, being a
Papist, had left the regiment), assembled the men at
his quarters, and formed them on parade in the court
of Lord Oslington's house, which was walled in. "The
country people, hearing that an Irish regiment was
there, came flocking from all parts to knock us on
the head; but Sir John bid them, at their peril, not
to approach, and told them we were not Irish Papists,
but true Church of England men; and seeing among
the crowd a gentleman, called to him, and desired he
would send to the minister of the parish to read
prayers to us, and if the minister did not convince
them we were all of the Church of England, we would
submit to their mercy. The minister was soon sent
for, and to prayers we went, repeating the responses
of the Liturgy so well and so exactly, that the
minister declared to the mob he never before heard
the responses of the Church of England prayers repeated
so distinctly and with so much devotion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
upon which the mob gave a huzza, and cried '<em>Long
live the Prince of Orange!</em>' and so returned home."<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>Soon afterwards the regiment marched to Hertfordshire,
and the Protestant officers of Hamilton's Irish
regiment were added to its numbers. The Irish Roman
Catholic soldiers were sent prisoners to the Isle of Wight,
and afterwards transferred to the service of the Emperor
of Germany.</p>

<p>Lord Forbes retiring from the service at this period,
the Prince of Orange conferred the colonelcy of the
regiment on Major Sir John Edgeworth, by commission
dated the 31st of December, 1688: at the same time
measures were adopted to recruit its diminished
numbers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1689</div>

<p>In the beginning of April, 1689, the regiment
marched to Chester, where it was stationed several
weeks.</p>

<p>Colonel Sir John Edgeworth having been guilty of
irregularity in procuring clothing, viz., purchasing the
old clothing of disbanded Roman Catholic soldiers,
from the Jews, to supply the recruits, instead of providing
new clothing, was deprived of his commission;
and on the 1st of May, 1689, the colonelcy was conferred
on <span class="smcap">Edward Earl of Meath</span>: Major Newcomb was
appointed lieut.-colonel, and Captain Frederick Hamilton
major.</p>

<p>Early in May the regiment marched into Wales.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Prince of Orange had been elevated
to the throne; but Earl Tyrconnel, who had been
nominated lord-lieutenant of Ireland in the preceding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
year, had retained that country in the Roman Catholic
interest; King James had arrived there with a body
of French troops, and the whole country was subject to
him, excepting Enniskillen and Londonderry, which
were defended by Protestants. To rescue the suffering
Protestants of Ireland from the power of their enemies,
King William assembled an army at Chester, under
Marshal Frederick Duke Schomberg; and the <span class="smcap">Earl
of Meath's</span> regiment being selected for this service,
marched to Highlake, where it embarked for Ireland,
and landing at White-house, near Belfast, on the 22nd
of August, joined the troops under Duke Schomberg,
who had commenced the siege of <em>Carrickfergus</em>, which
fortress surrendered a few days afterwards.</p>

<p>The regiment advanced with the army to Dundalk,
where a camp was formed on low, wet ground, which
occasioned great loss of life among the troops from
disease. No action of importance occurred during this
campaign, and the regiment passed the winter in
quarters at Lisburn, where it furnished a daily guard
at Duke Schomberg's quarters: its ranks were completed
by zealous Protestants, who were eager to
enrol themselves under its colours, and it was the
strongest corps in the army.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1690</div>

<p>In the summer of 1690, King William arrived in
Ireland, and the officers and soldiers of the regiment
had the honor of serving under the eye of their Sovereign.
They took part in the memorable battle of the
<em>Boyne</em>, on the 1st of July, when the army of King
William forced the passage of the river in the face of
the French and Irish forces under King James, and
gained a decisive victory.</p>

<p>From the Boyne the regiment marched with the
army towards Dublin, and at the general review at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Finglass, on the 7th and 8th of July, it mustered six
hundred and seventy-eight rank and file. It afterwards
proceeded towards <em>Limerick</em>, where the defeated army
of King James had rallied, and was prepared to make
a determined stand. On arriving before the town, the
regiment was detached, with three other corps, against
<em>Castle-Connell</em>, which surrendered on being summoned.</p>

<p>The British battering train was destroyed by a
detachment of the enemy, before it arrived at the
camp; but the King resolved to prosecute the siege,
and on the 20th of August the grenadiers of the
regiment, commanded by Captain Needham, with those
of Lord Cutts's regiment under Captain Foxon, entered
the trenches to storm one of the outworks near the
south-east corner of the wall. At two o'clock in the
afternoon the signal was given, when the grenadiers
rushed forward under a heavy fire, threw a shower of
hand-grenades into the outwork, and scaling the wall
with distinguished gallantry, captured the fort, killing
about fifty men, and making a captain and twelve men
prisoners: the remainder of the garrison escaped into
the town. The grenadiers maintained the post they
had captured; a sortie of the enemy was repulsed;
and when the soldiers of the regiment were relieved,
they retired: as they withdrew, Captain Needham was
killed by a random shot from the town.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>A breach being made in the wall, and the approaches
carried to the foot of the glacis, the King ordered a
general assault to be made, on the 27th of August, by
half the grenadiers of the army, supported by seven
battalions, to capture the covered way and two towers
near the breach: the <span class="smcap">Earl of Meath's</span> regiment was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
one of the corps selected for this service. The assault
was made with great gallantry; but, owing to some
misapprehension of orders, the attack failed, and the
several regiments engaged were forced to retire to the
trenches, with the loss of five hundred officers and
soldiers killed, and upwards of a thousand wounded.</p>

<p>The regiment had Lieutenant Latham and Ensign
Smith killed; Lieut.-Colonel Newcomb died of his
wounds; Colonel the Earl of Meath, Lieutenants Blakeney
and Hubblethorn, wounded; and upwards of a
hundred soldiers killed and wounded.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>The failure of this attack, with the approach of
unfavourable weather, occasioned His Majesty to raise
the siege, when the regiment marched with several
others, under Major-General Kirke, towards Mullingar;
but afterwards proceeded to the relief of <em>Birr</em>,
which was besieged by a body of the enemy under
Major-General Sarsfield, who retired behind the Shannon
on the approach of the British troops.</p>

<p>The regiment was afterwards stationed at Mullingar,
which was one of the frontier garrisons, and was
actively employed during the winter in making
incursions into the enemy's cantonments.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1691</div>

<p>Towards the end of April, 1691, a detachment of the
regiment, commanded by Lieut.-Colonel Hamilton,
accompanied a party under Colonel Brewer in a
sudden advance towards Dunore, to surprise two
thousand armed Roman Catholic peasantry, who had
taken post near that place. At daybreak on the following
morning the detachment approached the post, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
enemy formed for battle, but soon fled, and the
soldiers pursued and killed about fifty fugitives.</p>

<p>Quitting Mullingar in the early part of June, the
regiment was engaged in the operations of the army
under Lieut.-General Baron De Ghinkel, afterwards
Earl of Athlone:<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> it took part in the siege of <em>Ballymore</em>,
which place was captured in a few days; and afterwards
appeared before <em>Athlone</em>, in the siege of which
fortress it had several men killed and wounded.</p>

<p>A strong detachment of the regiment took part
in the capture of <em>Athlone</em> by storm, on which occasion
the assailants rushed through the rapid stream of
the Shannon, which was breast high, carried the enemy's
works in gallant style, and in less than half an hour
were masters of the town, to the surprise of General
St. Ruth, who commanded King James's army, which
was encamped near the fortress, and who was giving a
public entertainment in his camp, when the news of
the loss of <em>Athlone</em> reached him.</p>

<p>After putting the captured fortress in repair, the
army marched towards the enemy, who occupied a
strong position near the castle of <em>Aghrim</em>, and on the
12th of July a general engagement took place, in which
the Irish forces were overpowered and driven from the
field with severe loss, including General St. Ruth, who
was killed by a cannon ball. On this occasion the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
regiment formed part of the brigade under Major-General
Talmash: it had seven rank and file killed;
one major, two captains, one lieutenant, one ensign,
and eight rank and file wounded.</p>

<p>After this victory, the army marched to <em>Galway</em>,
which surrendered in a few days; and the victorious
English troops proceeded to <em>Limerick</em>, where the
remains of the defeated Irish forces had assembled,
and appeared determined to make a resolute stand,
in the hope of being reinforced from France. The
regiment had the honour to take part in the siege of
Limerick; and, the army having crossed the river
Shannon and completed the investment of the place,
the Irish soon afterwards surrendered the city, and
with it every other part of Ireland of which they
retained possession, the Irish regiments being permitted
to follow King James to France, or remain in
their own country, as they should choose: the "Royal
Regiment of Ireland" was one of the corps which proceeded
to France, and was taken into the service of
Louis XIV. The <span class="smcap">Earl of Meath's</span>, now <span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span>
regiment, was the only one of the eleven Irish corps
embodied by King Charles II. which remained in the
service of the English crown.</p>

<p>Ireland being rescued from the domination of King
James, the regiment went into quarters in the county
of Wicklow, and in December it proceeded to Waterford
and Youghal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1692</div>

<p>In the spring of 1692, the King of France assembled
an army near La Hogue, and prepared an immense
fleet to convey the troops to England, to replace King
James on the throne. When this menace of invasion
was given, the <span class="smcap">Earl of Meath's</span> and several other
regiments embarked at Waterford for England,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
and landing at Bristol, proceeded from thence to
Portsmouth. Meanwhile the British and Dutch fleets
had put to sea, and while the nations of Europe were
gazing, in anxious expectation, at these preparations,
the French navy was nearly annihilated in a decisive
action off La Hogue, when the alarm of invasion ceased.</p>

<p>Soon after this victory a powerful armament was
placed under the orders of Lieut.-General Meinhardt
Duke of Leinster (afterwards Duke Schomberg) for
the purpose of making a descent on the coast of France,
and the <span class="smcap">Earl of Meath's</span> regiment was one of the
corps which embarked on this service. The court of
France had, however, drawn so immense a number of
troops to the coast, that it was not thought advisable to
land, and the fleet sailed to the Downs, where orders
were received for a number of regiments to proceed to
Flanders. The transports sailed to Ostend, where the
<span class="smcap">Earl of Meath's</span> and several other corps landed, and
being joined by a detachment from the confederate
army under King William, they took and fortified the
towns of Furnes and Dixmude. This service being
completed, the regiment embarked for England; it
encountered a severe storm at sea, and the transports
were separated, but no loss was sustained; part of the
regiment arrived in the Thames, the remainder landed
at Harwich, and the whole were united at Bristol.</p>

<p>The Earl of Meath, being desirous of devoting his
attention to the interests of Ireland, retired from the
regiment, and was succeeded in the colonelcy by the
lieut.-colonel, <span class="smcap">Frederick Hamilton</span>; Major Ormsby
was promoted Lieut.-Colonel, and Captain Richard
Stearne Major.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1693</div>

<p>From Bristol the regiment marched in May, 1693, to
Portsmouth, where it embarked on board the fleet to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
serve as marines, and in June sailed to Torbay, where
the Dutch squadron joined. The first service undertaken
was the protection of about four hundred
merchant ships belonging to England, Holland,
Denmark, Sweden, Hamburg, and Flanders, engaged
in the Mediterranean trade. As the fleet proceeded
through the Channel, it presented a splendid appearance.
Captain Parker states&mdash;"All the sea, from the
line of battle to our English coast, seemed as a floating
wood covered with canvass; and as the weather
was very fair, the whole made a most glorious appearance."
After protecting the merchant-vessels through
the Bay of Biscay, the grand fleet returned, leaving a
squadron under Admiral Sir George Rooke, to continue
the voyage with them. The French monarch
had made powerful efforts to send to sea a formidable
fleet, which attempted to intercept the merchantmen
and convoy under Sir George Rooke. The English
admiral avoided an engagement with so superior a
force, and brought off the greater part of his fleet; but
many valuable vessels were captured or destroyed
by the enemy. On receiving news of this event, the
combined fleets of England and Holland attempted to
intercept the French naval force, but it got safe into
port.</p>

<p>In the autumn the regiment landed and marched to
Norwich.</p>

<p>During the campaign of this year, the confederate
army in Flanders had sustained severe loss at the
battle of <em>Landen</em>, and efforts were made to increase its
numbers, for which purpose Colonel <span class="smcap">Hamilton's</span> regiment
was ordered to proceed abroad. It marched to
London in December, was reviewed by King William
in Hyde Park, and embarking on the Thames, sailed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Ostend, where it landed, and was stationed several
months.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1694</div>

<p>Taking the field in the spring of 1694, the regiment
proceeded to the vicinity of Louvain, where it was
reviewed by the King, and afterwards took part in the
operations of the army. At the camp near Ramilies it
was formed in brigade under Major-General Ramsay,
and posted between two divisions of cavalry, in the
left wing; it afterwards shared in many toilsome
marches, also formed part of the covering army during
the siege of <em>Huy</em>, and subsequently marched into winter
quarters at Ghent.</p>

<p>During this campaign a question arose respecting
the rank of regiments, and the King directed the
subject to be submitted to a board of general officers.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
Captain Parker states,&mdash;"As the general officers were
most of them colonels of regiments raised in England
by King James II., they showed great partiality on
this occasion, for they would not allow the regiments,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
raised in Scotland or Ireland, to have any rank in
the army previous to the time of their coming to
England and entering upon English pay. By this
regulation, ours, that had been regimented in the time
of King Charles II., lost rank of eleven regiments,
that had been raised by King James II. The King
thought it very hard; but as he had left the matter
to them, he confirmed their sentence." The rank of
the regiment was thus fixed as <span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span> in the
British line; numerical titles were, however, not generally
used until the reign of George II.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1695</div>

<p>Taking the field to serve the campaign of 1695, the
regiment was formed in brigade with the Fifth, Seventh,
Twenty-third, Collingwood's (afterwards disbanded),
and La Melonière's regiment of French Protestants,
in the English service, under Brigadier-General Fitzpatrick.</p>

<p>When King William undertook the siege of the
important fortress of <em>Namur</em>, the regiment formed part
of the covering army under the Prince of Vaudemont,
against which a French force of very superior numbers
advanced under the orders of Marshal Villeroy. During
the night of the 14th of July, the hostile columns confronted
each other; the French, confident of success,
detached a body of troops to gain the rear of the allies,
and anxiously waited for daylight to commence the
action. The Prince of Vaudemont ordered his cavalry
forward; the dragoons dismounting and forming on
foot, while the artillery, and infantry with pikes trailed,
withdrew unobserved. The French prepared for the
attack, when the dragoons of the confederate forces
retired a few paces, mounted their horses, and retreated,
presenting to the surprised French what appeared to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the magic spectacle of an army vanishing out of sight.
The enemy pursued, but the allies retreated in good
order, and took up a position in front of Ghent. This
retreat has been celebrated by historians as a fine
specimen of the art of war.</p>

<p>The <span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span> were afterwards engaged in several
manœuvres for the preservation of the maritime towns
of Flanders; in the early part of August they were
encamped between Genappe and Waterloo, and afterwards
joined the forces under King William. In the
mean time the town of Namur had surrendered; but
the castle, a strong fortress situate on a rock, still held
out, and, on the 11th of August, the <span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span>
relieved one of the regiments which had suffered severely
in the siege, and took its turn of duty in the
trenches. A breach having been effected, arrangements
were made for a general assault. Three thousand
British, under Lord Cutts, were to attack the counterscarp
and the breach of the Terra Nova; three thousand
Bavarians the breach of the Cohorn; two thousand
Brandenburgers (Prussians) the upper point of the
Cohorn; two thousand Dutch the Casotte; and six
hundred men were to storm the lower town: the <span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span>
formed part of the British storming party.</p>

<p>The regiment marched into the trenches on the 20th
of August, to take part in storming the Castle of
Namur, and the soldiers were elated with the expectation
of distinguishing themselves under the eye of their
Sovereign. The trenches being crowded with troops,
the <span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span> and two other regiments were ordered
to Salsine Abbey, half a mile from the breach to be
attacked. A little before mid-day the assault was
made with heroic ardour, but, owing to some mistake
in the signal, all the corps did not advance simultaneously,
and the British grenadiers, who headed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
storming party, were opposed by very superior numbers,
and sustained severe loss; Lord Cutts being among
the wounded. Hurrying from Salsine Abbey to share
in the assault, the <span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span> approached the scene
of conflict a few moments after the grenadiers had
been repulsed and forced to retire; the regiment,
however, rushed forward, stormed the breach with
signal gallantry, and planted the regimental colours
on the summit; but the enemy had constructed
a strong work within the breach, which the utmost
efforts of the officers and soldiers could not force, and
after performing "prodigies of valour" they were
obliged to retreat with severe loss. The other attacks
were more successful; and lodgments were effected in
the works. Captain Parker states&mdash;"The King saw
this action from a rising ground at the back of
Salsine Abbey, and <em>took particular notice of the behaviour
of our regiment; for ours, only, mounted the top
of the breach, and we planted our colours thereon</em>, but
could not proceed farther, because a strong retrenchment
had been thrown up on the inside, which we
could not see till we had mounted the very top of the
breach, so we were obliged to follow the crowd. His
Majesty, on this occasion, was pleased to honour us
with the title of '<span class="fs70">THE ROYAL REGIMENT OF FOOT OF
IRELAND</span>.'"<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> The King also conferred on the regiment
the privilege of bearing his own arms, "<span class="smcap">the
Lion of Nassau</span>," on its colours (on which the cross
of St. Patrick had previously been displayed); also the
"<span class="smcap">Harp in a blue field and a crown over it</span>," and
the motto, "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Virtutis Namurcensis Præmium</i>."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>
<p>The title was afterwards changed to "<span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH
REGIMENT</span>."</p>

<p>The regiment sustained severe loss on this occasion;
Lieut.-Colonel Ormsby, Captains Purefoy, Pinsent,
and Cateret, Lieutenants Fitzmorris and Ramme,
Ensigns Fettyplace, Blunt, Baker, and Hayter, with
eighty-six non-commissioned officers and soldiers, were
killed: Captain John Southwell and Ensign Lister
died of their wounds; Colonel Frederick Hamilton,
Captains Kane, Duroure, Seymour, and William Southwell,
Lieutenants La Planche, Brereton, Hybert,
Arphaxad, and Rolleston, Ensigns John Gifford, Ormsby,
and Blakeney, with one hundred and eighty-five
non-commissioned officers and soldiers, were wounded.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>The fire against the castle was continued, and preparations
were made for another assault, which was
prevented by the surrender of the garrison. Thus was
captured the celebrated fortress of <em>Namur</em>, which reflected
great credit on the confederate armies.</p>

<p>This conquest terminated the campaign, and the
regiment passed the winter in garrison at Ghent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1696</div>

<p>During the campaign of 1696, the regiment served
with the army of Flanders under the Prince of Vaudemont;
and was formed in brigade with a battalion of the
Royals, the third, fifth, and seventeenth regiments under
Brigadier-General Selwyn; and its services were limited
to the protection of Ghent, Bruges, and the maritime
towns of Flanders. In the autumn it returned to Ghent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1697</div>

<p>Leaving Ghent in the spring of 1697, the regiment
joined the army of Brabant under King William, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
took part in the movements of this campaign; which
were terminated by the treaty of Ryswick, when the
British monarch saw his efforts for the liberty of
Europe, and the preservation of the Protestant religion,
attended with success.</p>

<p>On the termination of hostilities, the regiment
marched to Ghent, where it was quartered several
weeks, and on the 10th of December embarked at
Ostend for Ireland. As two of the transports approached
the Irish coast, they were chased by a Sallee
man-of-war of eighteen guns, carrying Zealand colours.
Seeing his brave soldiers in danger of being made
slaves, Lieut.-Colonel Stearne called them on deck;
the whole resolved on a desperate defence; and it was
arranged that when the Sallee man-of-war attacked
one transport, the other should come to its assistance,
and the enemy should be boarded by the soldiers
sword in hand, not doubting but that they would overpower
the Turks and Moors, and capture the ship.
With this view the soldiers were kept out of sight to
induce the enemy to make an attack, and every man
was ready for action. "The Sallee man-of-war kept
us company about an hour, and was once, as we
thought, coming up to board us; however, she
thought better of it, fell astern, and stood off without
firing a shot."<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> During the following night the two
transports narrowly escaped destruction from a storm;
they afterwards arrived safe in Bantry Bay; the soldiers
landed on the 24th of December, and marched to Cork,
where the regiment was assembled.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1699</div>

<p>From Cork the regiment marched, in July, 1698, to
Waterford; in the spring of 1699 it proceeded to Dublin,
and in 1700 it was removed to Kinsale.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">1700</div>

<p>Pursuing those schemes of aggrandizement which
had repeatedly involved Europe in war, Louis XIV.
procured the accession of his grandson, Philip Duke
of Anjou, to the throne of Spain, in violation of existing
treaties; seized on the Spanish Netherlands; and
made prisoners the Dutch troops in garrison in the
barrier towns. The sudden acquisition of the Spanish
monarchy by a grandson of the most ambitious and
potent monarch of Europe, with the prospect of France
and Spain being eventually united under one sovereign,
affected the interests and agitated the public mind of
all countries.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1701</div>

<p>War was resolved upon: the standing armies were
augmented; and while the din of hostile preparation
was heard on every side, the <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span> regiment
was placed upon a war establishment, and embarked
for Holland, where it arrived, with several other corps,
in July, 1701, and was placed in garrison at Huesden.
On the 21st of September it was reviewed on Breda-heath
by King William III.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1702</div>

<p>Quitting Huesden in March, 1702, the regiment
proceeded to Rosendael, where the British infantry
was assembled under Brigadier-General Ingoldsby;
and at this place the troops received information of
the death of King William III., on the 8th of March,
and of the accession of Queen Anne.</p>

<p>From Rosendael the regiment marched to the duchy
of Cleves, and formed part of the army encamped at
Cranenburg during the siege of <em>Kayserswerth</em>, on the
Lower Rhine, by the Germans. A French force of
very superior numbers attempting to cut off the communication
of the army at Cranenburg with <em>Nimeguen</em>,
the troops struck their tents on the 10th of June, and
by a forced march during the night arrived within a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
miles of Nimeguen as the French legions approached.
Some sharp fighting occurred, in which the British
corps in the rear-guard evinced great gallantry, and the
army effected its retreat under the works of the fortress.</p>

<p>Additional forces having arrived from England, the
<span class="smcap">Earl of Marlborough</span><a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> assumed the command of the
allied army, and by a series of skilful movements he
forced the French army to make a precipitate retreat
from the frontiers of Holland to their own lines, and
he twice attempted to bring on a general engagement
under advantageous circumstances, but was restrained
by the Dutch field deputies. The French forces having
fled to their lines, the English General resolved to
attack their fortified towns, and the <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span> regiment
was one of the corps detached from the main
army to undertake the siege of the fortress of <em>Venloo</em>,
situate on the east side of the river Maese, in the
province of Limburg.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> On the west side of the river
was a detached fortification of five bastions, called <em>Fort
St. Michael</em>, against which the British troops carried
on their approaches;&mdash;the Dutch and Germans attacking
other parts of the town: the whole were under
Veldt-Marshal Prince Nassau-Saarbruck. The approaches
being carried to the foot of the glacis, orders
were given to storm the covered-way, and make a
lodgment on the top of the glacis; and the <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span>
regiment, being on duty in the trenches at the time,
was appointed to make the attack, together with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>grenadiers of the brigade, and a party of chosen fusiliers.
Captain Parker has given the following account
of this attack:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Lord Cutts sent for all the officers, and told
them, the design was to drive the enemy from the
covered-way, that they might not disturb the workmen
in making a lodgment; however, if the enemy
gave way with precipitation, we were to jump into
the covered-way, and pursue them, let the consequence
be what it would. We all thought these
were very rash orders, contrary both to the rules of
war, and the design of the attack.</p>

<p>"About four in the afternoon (18th September), the
signal was given, and, according to our orders, we
rushed up the covered-way; the enemy gave us one
scattering fire, and away they ran: we jumped into
the covered-way, and ran after them. They made
to a ravelin, which covered the curtain of the fort,
in which were a captain and sixty men. We, seeing
them get into the ravelin, pursued them, got in with
them, and soon put most of them to the sword. They
that escaped us fled over a small wooden bridge,
that led over the moat to the fort; and here, like
madmen, without fear or wit, we pursued them over
that tottering bridge, exposed to the fire of the great
and small shot of the fort. However, we got over
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fausse-braye</span>, where we had nothing for it but to
take the fort or die. They that fled before us
climbed up by the long grass that grew out of the
fort; so we climbed after them. Here we were hard
put to it to pull out the palisades, which pointed
down upon us from the parapet, and, was it not for
the great surprise and consternation of those within,
we could never have surmounted this very point:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
but, as soon as they saw us at this work, they quitted
the rampart, and retired down to the parade in the
body of the fort, where they laid down their arms
and cried for quarter, which was readily granted
them. Thus were the unaccountable orders of Lord
Cutts as unaccountably executed, to the great surprise
of the whole army, and even of ourselves, when
we came to reflect on what we had done."</p>

<p>The enemy had about four hundred killed, and two
hundred made prisoners. The British loss, in killed
and wounded, did not exceed forty men.</p>

<p>Captain Parker, of the <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span> regiment, adds,&mdash;"This
affair was the occasion of another almost as
surprising. An express came to Prince Nassau which
gave an account that Landau was taken; whereupon
he ordered the army to draw down near the town, to
fire three rounds (as a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">feu de-joie</span>); the cannon also
of all the batteries, the mortars, and cohorns, were
ordered to fire, with the troops, into the town.
When the garrison and inhabitants saw us drawing
down on all sides, they judged it was with a design
of making such an attack on the town as we had
made on the fort, which struck such a terror into
them, that the magistrates begged the Governor to
capitulate, and not suffer them all to be put to the
sword. The first round of all our batteries, and the
small shot of the army, so affrighted them, that men,
women, and children, came flocking to the ramparts
with white cloths in their hands, crying, 'Mercy!
mercy!' and the Governor, in as great a consternation
as the rest, sent out an officer to the Prince to
desire a capitulation, which was immediately granted;
as we had other sieges to carry on this season, the
Prince allowed them honourable terms."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>After the capture of Venloo, the regiment was
employed in the siege of the fortress of <em>Ruremonde</em>,
which was captured in a short time; and Stevenswart
having also been reduced by a detachment from the
covering army, the navigation of the Maese was thus
cleared of the enemy up to Maestricht.</p>

<p>Rejoining the main army after this achievement, the
regiment advanced towards the city of <em>Liège</em>, the
French forces retiring as the British approached, but
leaving a strong garrison in the citadel and Chartreuse.
The <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span> regiment was employed in the siege
of the citadel of Liège, and its grenadier company had
the honour to take part in the capture of that fortress
by storm, on the 23rd of October, when the British
soldiers highly distinguished themselves. They were
permitted to appropriate a large quantity of dollars
and silver plate, captured on this occasion, to their
own use.</p>

<p>From the pleasant valley of Liège, the regiment
commenced its march, on the 3rd of November, back
to Holland, and passed the winter in garrison at
Huesden.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1703</div>

<p>Quitting its winter quarters in April, 1703, the
regiment traversed the country to Maestricht, and
was in position near that city when the French forces,
under Marshals Villeroy and Boufflers, made a sudden
advance to surprise the British troops in their quarters,
but were defeated in their design.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Duke of Marlborough</span> assembled the army
near Maestricht, and the <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span> regiment was
formed in brigade with the eighth, thirteenth, seventeenth,
and thirty-third, under its colonel, Brigadier-General
F. Hamilton; and it advanced with the
army towards Tongres, when the French quitted their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
post and eventually retired within their fortified lines,
where the English General was desirous of attacking
them, but was prevented by the Dutch commanders
and field deputies. The services of the regiment
were afterwards connected with the siege of <em>Huy</em>,
which fortress was captured in ten days.</p>

<p>The <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span> regiment formed part of the
covering army during the siege of <em>Limburg</em>, which was
commenced on the 10th of September, and on the 27th
of that month the Governor surrendered. Spanish
Guelderland being thus delivered from the power of
France, the Dutch were freed from the danger of an
invasion.</p>

<p>After taking part in these services the regiment
marched to Breda: during the severe frosts of winter
it proceeded to Bergen-op-Zoom, to reinforce the
garrison of that fortress, and afterwards returned to
Breda, from whence it detached three hundred men
to Maestricht, to join the garrison of that city, while
the Dutch soldiers were working at the entrenchments
on the heights of Petersberg.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1704</div>

<p>Meanwhile the united French and Bavarian armies
had gained considerable advantage in Germany, and
the Duke of Marlborough resolved to lead his British
brigades from the ocean to the Danube, to rescue the
Emperor of Germany from the menaced danger. To
engage in this splendid undertaking, the <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span>
regiment marched from Breda on the 5th of May,
N.S., and proceeded towards the Rhine; being joined
at Bedburg by the detachment from Maestricht.
Continuing its route, the regiment proceeded to
Coblentz, where it passed the Moselle and the
Rhine, and afterwards traversed the minor states of
Germany towards the seat of war on the Danube;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
all Europe being surprised at the ability evinced by
the British commander in conducting this daring
enterprise.</p>

<p>Having united with the forces of the Empire, the
British advanced on the 2nd of July to attack a body
of French and Bavarians under Count d'Arco, in an
entrenched camp on the heights of <em>Schellenberg</em>, on the
left bank of the Danube. About six in the evening
the leading division, of which a detachment of the
<span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span> regiment formed part, moved forward
under a heavy fire, and attacked the enemy's entrenchments
with distinguished gallantry. The enemy made
a determined resistance, and the assailants were repulsed;
but the attack was renewed with heroic courage,
and, after a protracted contest, the Germans co-operated
in the attack, when the entrenchments were forced,
and the French and Bavarians driven from the heights
with great slaughter. The British cavalry, charging,
completed the discomfiture of the enemy, and sixteen
pieces of ordnance, a number of standards and colours,
with the enemy's tents, and the equipage and plate of
the Count d'Arco, were captured.</p>

<p>The regiment had one serjeant and eleven rank and
file killed; Captain Lea, Ensigns Gilman, Walsh, and
Pensant, three serjeants, and thirty-two rank and file
wounded.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>The victory at Schellenberg was followed by the
flight of the enemy from Donawerth; and the regiment
was engaged in the operations of the army which
penetrated Bavaria, and captured <em>Rayn</em> after a short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
siege. The Elector of Bavaria formed an entrenched
camp at Augsburg, to which city the allied army advanced;
but found the enemy's camp too strong to be
attacked with any prospect of success, and the troops
retired a short distance. The siege of <em>Ingoldstadt</em> was
commenced by the Germans, and the <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span>
regiment formed part of the covering army.</p>

<p>Quitting his camp at Augsburg, the Elector of
Bavaria joined a strong body of French troops sent to
reinforce his army, and the united divisions encamped
in the valley of the Danube, near the village of
<em>Blenheim</em>.</p>

<p>At three o'clock on the morning of the memorable
13th of August, 1704, the allied army advanced towards
the enemy, and about three o'clock in the afternoon the
British developed their attack against the French
brigades posted in the village of Blenheim; thus
commencing an engagement in which the English
troops acquired great distinction. The village being
found strongly fortified, it was environed by a few corps,
and the army passed the little river Nebel to attack
the enemy's lines. The <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span> regiment directed
its attacks against the right wing of the Gallo-Bavarian
army, and was engaged with the chosen troops
of France, under Marshal Tallard; its heroic conduct
reflected the highest lustre on the British arms, and it
contributed materially to the complete overthrow and
discomfiture of the opposing host. The French were
chased from the field with great slaughter, and the
loss of their cannon, baggage, and many troops captured,
including the brigades posted in the village of Blenheim:
Marshal Tallard, and several officers of distinction,
were among the prisoners. The left wing of the
enemy was also overpowered by the Germans, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
victory was complete and decisive: the powerful armies
of France and Bavaria being literally destroyed.
Thus, on the banks of the Danube, was achieved by
British valour a trophy which will serve as a monument
to commemorate the national glory to the end
of time. The conduct of the brave soldiers who
conquered in the interior of Germany was the admiration
of surrounding states, and has been lauded by
numerous historians: the <span class="smcap">Duke of Marlborough</span>
was elevated to the dignity of a <span class="smcap">Prince</span> of the <span class="smcap">Roman
Empire</span>.</p>

<p>The loss of the <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span> regiment was Captains
Brown, Rolleston, and Vaughan, Ensign Moyle, five
serjeants, and fifty-two rank and file killed; Major
Kane, Captains Lepenitor and Hussey, Lieutenants
Smith, Roberts, Blakeney, and Harvey, Ensign Trips,
nine serjeants, and eighty-seven rank and file
wounded.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>From the Danube, the regiment traversed the
country to the banks of the Rhine, crossed that river
at Philipsburg on the 7th of September, and formed
part of the covering army encamped at Croon-Weissemberg
during the siege of <em>Landau</em>, which was undertaken
by the Germans. When the siege drew towards
a close, the regiment marched to Germersheim, where
it embarked in boats on the Rhine, and in twelve days
arrived at Nimeguen, where it landed, and, marching
to Ruremonde, passed the winter at that place.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1705</div>

<p>Brigadier-General Hamilton, having become advanced
in years, retired from active service, and was
permitted to dispose of the colonelcy of the regiment to
Lieut.-General Ingoldsby, from the twenty-third foot,
who was appointed colonel of the <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span> regiment
by commission dated the 1st of April, 1705.</p>

<p>From Ruremonde the regiment marched to the
vicinity of Maestricht, where it joined the army; and
afterwards proceeded by Juliers, through a mountainous
country, to the valley of the Moselle, where it encamped
near the city of Treves. The army passed the
Moselle and the Saar in the early part of June, with
the view of carrying on the war in that direction; but
the Duke of Marlborough, being disappointed of the
co-operation of the Germans, marched his army back
to the Netherlands, which occasioned the soldiers much
fatigue. On arriving at the Maese, a detachment was
employed in recapturing <em>Huy</em>, which the enemy had
taken during the absence of the army up the Moselle.</p>

<p>A formidable barrier of forts and entrenchments had
been constructed with great labour and expense to arrest
the progress of the British General; but by menacing
the lines to the south of the Mehaine, to draw the
French army to that quarter, and afterwards making a
forced march to the right during the night of the 17th
of July, these stupendous works were passed at <em>Helixem</em>
and <em>Neer-Hespen</em>, with little opposition; and the French
and Bavarian troops, which hurried to the spot to drive
back the leading corps of the allied army, were repulsed
with severe loss. The <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span> regiment
was formed in brigade on this occasion with the
twenty-fourth, twenty-ninth, and Temple's (afterwards
disbanded), under Brigadier-General Webb, and,
being in the main body of the army, did not sustain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
any loss. After this brilliant success, the designs of
the British commander were frustrated by the opposition
of the Dutch Generals, and little further advantage
was gained.</p>

<p>The regiment returned to Holland for winter quarters,
and was stationed at Worcum.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1706</div>

<p>Taking the field in May, 1706, the regiment proceeded
to the general rendezvous of the army near
Tongres, and, advancing from thence in the direction
of Mont St. André, on Whit-Sunday the 23rd of May,
the British commander discovered a powerful French
army, under Marshal Villeroy and the Elector of
Bavaria, in position at that place, with their centre at
the village of <em>Ramilies</em>, which was occupied by a considerable
body of troops.</p>

<p>Diverging into the plain, the allied army formed
line and advanced towards the enemy; the <span class="fs70">ROYAL
IRISH</span> regiment, being in the right wing, formed on the
heights of Foulz, and, descending into the low grounds
near the Little Gheet river, menaced the enemy's left,
at Autreglise and Offuz, with an attack. This movement
occasioned the enemy to weaken his centre to
support his left flank, when the Duke of Marlborough
instantly reinforced his centre, and made a determined
attack upon the enemy's position at the weakened
point. For some time the officers and soldiers of the
<span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span> regiment were spectators of the fight;
but at a critical moment they were brought forward,
and they contributed to the complete overthrow of the
forces of France, Spain, and Bavaria. The warlike
brigades of the enemy, a few hours before so formidable
and menacing, were driven from the field with great
slaughter, and the loss of many officers and soldiers
taken prisoners, also of their cannon and many stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>ards
and colours. After pursuing the fugitives a
considerable distance, the regiment halted for the night,
surrounded by the ensanguined trophies of this day of
glorious triumph to the British arms.</p>

<p>Retreating to Louvain, the broken remains of the
enemy's splendid army halted a short time, and
soon afterwards abandoned that city, and also Lierre,
Ghent, Damme, and Bruges. The magistrates of
these towns, together with those of Brussels, Malines,
and Alost, renounced their allegiance to the Duke of
Anjou, and declared in favour of the House of Austria.
The garrisons of Oudenarde and Antwerp surrendered;
Ostend withstood a short siege and then capitulated.
Thus the successes of the allied arms were splendid
beyond all precedent.</p>

<p>Towards the end of July, the <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span> regiment
was detached from the main army to take part in the
siege of the fortress of <em>Menin</em>, which was considered one
of the masterpieces of <span class="smcap">Vauban</span>, the celebrated French
engineer, and was provided with a numerous garrison
well supplied with everything necessary for a protracted
defence. The garrison disputed every yard of ground
with sanguinary tenacity; but the allies carried on the
siege with vigour, and brought their approaches to the
foot of the glacis, where a storming party was assembled
to attack the covered-way. The <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span> regiment
was appointed to take part in this service. The
signal being given, the assailants rushed forward to the
palisades, and threw a shower of hand-grenades into
the covered-way; then, entering amidst the confusion,
overthrew all opposition. General Stearne states,&mdash;"This
proved warm service; for though we drove the
enemy at once out of the counterscarp, they sprung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
two mines upon us, and from their works plied us
with a most violent fire, which we lay exposed to
until our workmen had thrown up an entrenchment
sufficient to cover us. In this action our regiment
had six officers and upwards of eighty soldiers killed
and wounded."<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>The Governor, finding himself unable to arrest the
progress of the besieging force, surrendered.</p>

<p>The fortress of <em>Aeth</em> was afterwards captured, and
this event terminated the campaign. Thus fortresses
which had resisted powerful armies for months and
years, and provinces disputed for ages, were the conquests
of a summer: the nations of Europe witnessing
with astonishment the splendid achievements of the
forces under the Duke of Marlborough. After sharing
in the brilliant successes of this campaign, the <span class="fs70">ROYAL
IRISH</span> regiment passed the winter at Ghent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1707</div>

<p>In May, 1707, the regiment again took the field, and
was formed in brigade with the second battalion of the
Royals, the eighth, twenty-fourth, and Temple's regiments,
under Brigadier-General Sir Richard Temple
(afterwards Viscount Cobham). During this campaign,
the French army avoided a general engagement, and
the summer was passed by the opposing armies in
manœuvring and watching each other's movements.
In the autumn, the regiment marched to the castle of
Ghent, of which its commanding officer, Colonel Stearne,
was appointed governor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1708</div>

<p>Finding his armies beaten on the continent, the
French monarch fitted out an expedition for the purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
of landing the Pretender in Scotland, to embroil
Great Britain in civil war; and the <span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span> regiment
was one of the corps ordered home to repel the invaders:
it embarked from Ostend in the middle of March,
1708, and sailed to the river Tyne; but the English
fleet chased the French squadron from the British
coast, and the regiment returned to Flanders.</p>

<p>When the opposing armies took the field, the French
had obtained possession of Ghent and Bruges by treachery;
but the English General surprised the French on
the march near <em>Oudenarde</em> on the 11th of June, and
gained a decisive victory. The <span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span> regiment
formed part of the leading brigade of the van of the
army, under Major-General Cadogan, and with the
eighth, twenty-third, and thirty-seventh regiments, descended
from the high grounds between Eyne and
Bevere, forded a rivulet, and attacked seven battalions
of the Swiss regiments of Pfeffer, Villars, and
Gueder, which had taken post at Eyne: after a sharp
contest British valour prevailed, and Brigadier-General
Pfeffer, with three entire battalions, were made prisoners
of war: the remainder were either killed, or intercepted
in their attempt to escape, and made prisoners.
The <span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span> afterwards attacked a body of troops
posted in the enclosures, and soon drove the French
from their ground. As the regiment was advancing in
pursuit, a numerous body of French cavalry menaced
it in front and flank, and it fell back to the hedges,
where it repulsed the French horsemen. Other
British brigades arriving, the whole advanced; a fierce
conflict of musketry ensued, and charge succeeded
charge until darkness put an end to the conflict, and
thus saved the French army from complete annihilation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
The enemy made a precipitate retreat during the
night.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel Stearne commanded the regiment on
this occasion, and he states in his journal,&mdash;"Our regiment,
though the first that engaged, had only one
lieutenant and eight men killed, and twelve men
wounded."</p>

<p>The <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span> regiment formed part of the force
employed in the siege of the important fortress of
<em>Lisle</em>, the capital of French Flanders, and the regiment
had numerous opportunities of distinguishing itself
during the long and determined defence made by a
numerous garrison under Marshal Boufflers. The
citadel did not surrender until the 9th of December.
The <span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span> had two captains and three subalterns
killed, the major and several other officers wounded,
and two hundred non-commissioned officers and soldiers
killed and wounded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1709</div>

<p>A strong detachment of recruits replaced the losses
of the regiment, and it was in a highly efficient state
when it took the field to serve the campaign of 1709.
The Duke of Marlborough menaced the French army
with an attack, which occasioned Marshal Villars to
weaken the garrisons of the fortified towns to strengthen
the army in the field, when the allies besieged <em>Tournay</em>.
The <span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span> were detached, under the Prince of
Orange, to drive the French detachment from Mortagne
and St. Amand, and, having accomplished this service,
joined the besieging army, and carried on its approaches
at the seven fountains. The regiment was
engaged in storming the breaches in the Ravelin and
Half-Moon; and on the 29th of July it was in readiness
to take part in storming the town, which was prevented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
by the surrender of the place, the garrison retiring into
the citadel.</p>

<p>The <span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span> took part in the siege of the citadel
of Tournay, which was celebrated for the extent of its
underground works. Captain Parker, of the regiment,
states in his journal,&mdash;"Our approaches against this
citadel were carried on mostly underground, by sinking
pits several fathom deep, and working from
thence until we came to their casemates and mines.
These extended a great way from the body of the
citadel, and in them our men and the enemy frequently
met, and fought with sword and pistol. We
could not prevent them springing several mines
which blew up some of our batteries, guns and all,
and a great many men, in particular a captain,
lieutenant, and forty (the London Gazette says
thirty) men of our regiment." The <span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span>
lost a lieutenant and several men in the combats
underground; and ten grenadiers were suffocated in
one of the galleries. In the early part of September
the governor surrendered.</p>

<p>From Tournay the army marched in the direction
of Mons, and, the French taking up a position near
<em>Malplaquet</em>, a general engagement took place on the
11th of September, when the enemy was forced from
his entrenchments with loss. Captain Parker states,&mdash;"The
part which our regiment acted in this battle was
something remarkable. We happened to be the last
of the regiments which had been left at Tournay to
level the approaches, and did not come up till the
lines were formed. We were ordered to draw up
on the right of the army, opposite a skirt of the wood
of Sart, and, when the army advanced to attack the
enemy, we entered the wood in our front. We con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>tinued
marching till we came to a small plain, on the
opposite side of which we perceived a battalion of
the enemy drawn up, a skirt of the wood being in
its rear. Colonel Kane, who was then at the head
of the regiment, having drawn us up, and formed
our platoons, advanced towards the enemy, with the
six platoons of our first fire made ready. When we
arrived within a hundred paces of them, they gave
us a fire of one of their ranks; whereupon we halted,
and returned them the fire of our six platoons at
once, and immediately made ready the six platoons
of our second fire, and advanced upon them again.
They then gave us the fire of another rank; and we
returned them a second fire, which made them
shrink; however they gave us the fire of a third rank,
after a scattering manner, and then retired into the
wood in great disorder; on which we sent our third
fire after them and saw them no more. We advanced
up to the ground which they had quitted, and found
several of them killed and wounded; and among the
latter was one Lieutenant O'Sulivan, who told us
the battalion we had engaged was the '<span class="smcap">Royal Regiment
of Ireland</span>.'<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Here, therefore, was a
fair trial between the <span class="smcap">two Royal Regiments of
Ireland</span>, one in the <span class="smcap">British</span> and the other in the
<span class="smcap">French</span> service; for we met each other upon equal
terms, and there was none else to interpose. We had
but four men killed and six wounded; and found
near forty of them on the spot killed and wounded.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
The advantage on our side will be easily accounted
for, first from the weight of our ball; for the French
arms carry bullets of 24 to the pound, whereas our
British firelocks carry ball of 16 only to the pound,
which will make a considerable difference in the execution:
again, the manner of our firing was different
from theirs; the French, at that time, fired all
by ranks, which can never do equal execution with
our platoon firing."</p>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel Stearne gives nearly the same particulars,
and adds&mdash;"We marched into the wood after
them (the Royal Irish in the French service); and
when we had got through, we found our army
mounting the enemy's last entrenchments, and our
brother <em>harpers</em><a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> scoured off as fast as their heels
could carry them. Thus ended this great and
terrible battle, which was the most obstinate engagement
on both sides that has been known in the
memory of man: the killed and wounded on both
sides was very great."</p>

<p>The <span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span> were afterwards employed in
covering the siege of <em>Mons</em>, and passed the winter in
quarters at Ghent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1710</div>

<p>From Ghent the regiment advanced on the 14th of
April, 1710, and took part in the operations by which
the French lines were passed at <em>Pont-à-Vendin</em>; and
also formed part of the covering army during the siege
of <em>Douay</em>, and also during the siege of <em>Bethune</em>; and
was afterwards detached, under the Prince of Anhalt,
to attack the town of <em>Aire</em>, situate on the banks of the
river Lys. In the siege of this place many difficulties
had to be overcome, from the nature of the ground,
and from the determined defence of a numerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
garrison: the <span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span> regiment had three officers
killed, and five wounded; also about eighty soldiers
killed and wounded. The garrison surrendered on the
9th of November; and the regiment, afterwards returned
to Ghent.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1711</div>

<p>The <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span> again took the field in April, 1711,
and were employed in the operations by which the
boasted impregnable French lines were passed at
<em>Arleux</em>, and the opportunity of attacking the fortified
town of <em>Bouchain</em>, situated on both sides of the river
<em>Scheldt</em>, was ensured. The regiment formed part of
a detachment of twenty battalions, commanded by
Lieut.-General the Earl of Orkney, which took post
on the north and north-west side of the town and river,
and advanced to drive the French from the heights of
Wavrechin. Captain Parker states, "Our British
grenadiers marched to the top of the hill on the left
of their works, in order to begin the attack on that
side: here we were posted in a field of wheat, about
seventy or eighty paces from their works, expecting
every moment the signal to fall on. I must confess
I did not like the aspect of the thing: we plainly saw
their entrenchment was a perfect bulwark, strong and
lofty, and crowded with men, and cannon pointed
directly at us: we wished much that the Duke might
take a nearer view. * * * * While I was
musing, the Duke of Marlborough, ever watchful,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
ever right, rode up unattended, and posted himself
on the right of my company of grenadiers, from whence
he had a fair view of the greater part of the enemy's
works. It is quite impossible for me to express the
joy which the sight of this man gave me. I was well
satisfied he would not push the thing unless he saw
a strong probability of success; nor was this my
notion alone; it was the sense of the whole army,
both officers and soldiers, British and Foreigners;
and, indeed, we had all the reason in the world for it,
for he never led us on to any one action that we did
not succeed in. He stayed only three or four minutes,
and then rode back: we were in pain for him while
he stayed, lest the enemy might have discovered him,
and fired at him, in which case they could not well
have missed him. He had not been longer from us
than he stayed when orders came to us to retire.
As the corn we stood in was high, we slipped off
undiscovered, and were a good way down the hill
before they perceived that we were retiring, and
then they let fly all their great and small shot after
us; but as we were by this time under the brow of
the hill, all their shot went over our heads." This
statement of a distinguished officer of the <span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span>
regiment shows how fully the great Duke of Marlborough
possessed the confidence of his troops.</p>

<p>During the siege of <em>Bouchain</em>, the <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span>
regiment was actively engaged in the trenches and the
attacks; but did not sustain a very severe loss. Lieut.-Colonel
Stearne states,&mdash;"In this siege our regiment
had four officers wounded but none killed, and about
forty men killed and wounded; the grenadiers suffered
most. Bouchain being taken, our regiment was ordered
to Tournay, where we were quartered the
remaining part of the campaign, from whence we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
escorted what provision came that way to the army
which continued about Bouchain." In October the regiment
marched to Lisle, where it passed the winter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1712</div>

<p>In February, 1712, Lieut.-General Ingoldsby died,
and was succeeded in the colonelcy of the regiment by
Lieut.-Colonel Stearne, who had held a commission in
the corps thirty-four years, and wrote an account of its
services.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>From Lisle the regiment advanced in April to some
high ground beyond Bouchain, where a camp was formed
of several corps, and entrenchments thrown up. The
<span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span> regiment afterwards joined the army under
the orders of the Duke of Ormond, and its grenadier
company advanced on a reconnoitring party into
Picardy; but a suspension of hostilities took place soon
afterwards, and the army withdrew to Ghent, where
the regiment passed the winter. The power of France
was reduced, its armies defeated, its frontier towns
captured, its ambitious monarch was forced to sue for
peace, and the treaty of Utrecht gave repose to Europe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1713</div>

<p>The <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span> regiment had acquired a high
reputation during the war; and a board of officers
being assembled in London, to decide on the rank of
regiments, Colonel Stearne sent Captain Parker to
England to claim rank for the regiment from the date
of its formation in 1684, which would have given it
rank as <span class="fs70">FIFTH</span> foot; but this was not granted, and it
continued to take date and rank in the English army
from the time of its arrival in England in the autumn
of 1688.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>During the winter, a very serious mutiny occurred
among the troops stationed at Ghent, to which the
soldiers were incited by a man, whom Captain Parker
calls "a pettifogging attorney from London," who had
entered the <span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span> regiment. This dangerous
combination was suppressed, and ten of the ringleaders
were executed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1714</div>

<p>After the conclusion of the treaty of peace, the
British regiments quitted Flanders, excepting the
eighth and <span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span>, which were appointed to
garrison the citadel of Ghent until the barrier treaty
was signed. The Duke and Duchess of Marlborough
passing through Ghent, the officers of the two regiments
met His Grace without the town, to show their respect
to the character of their former commander.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1715</div>

<p>On the breaking out of the rebellion of the Earl of
Mar, in the autumn of 1715, the regiment was ordered
to proceed to England, leaving the lieut.-colonel and a
hundred men in the castle of Ghent; it landed at
Greenwich, and marched to Gloucester, where it was
joined by the party from Ghent in February following.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1716</div>

<p>From Gloucester the regiment marched to <em>Oxford</em>;
many persons at this celebrated university were
disaffected to the government of King George I., and
on the Prince of Wales's birthday, when the officers of
the regiment were assembled at one of the inns, to
celebrate the day, they were assailed by stones thrown
from a house on the opposite side of the street. A
number of soldiers, hearing that their officers had been
thus assailed by the Jacobites, came running to the
spot, and soon destroyed the windows of the house
from whence the stones had been thrown. They afterwards
went from street to street, and broke the windows
of persons who refused to illuminate for the Prince of
Wales's birthday. The Vice-Chancellor sent a com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>plaint
to His Majesty's privy council, and the officers
were called upon for an explanation. The subject was
afterwards investigated by the House of Lords, and,
after several debates, the university was censured for
not observing the birthday of the Prince of Wales,
afterwards King George II.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1717</div>

<p>In May, 1717, the regiment marched to Portsmouth,
where it received orders to hold itself in readiness to
proceed abroad.</p>

<p>Brigadier-General Stearne obtained permission to
dispose of the colonelcy of the regiment to Lieut.-Colonel
William Cosby, from the first troop, now first
regiment of life guards.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1718</div>

<p>Soon afterwards the regiment embarked for the
island of Minorca, where it arrived in the early part of
1718, and it was stationed there many years, during
which period little occurred worthy of being recorded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1727</div>

<p>In 1727, when the Spaniards besieged <em>Gibraltar</em>, a
detachment from the regiments at Minorca proceeded
to that fortress, under Colonel Cosby of the <span class="fs70">ROYAL
IRISH</span> regiment, to reinforce the garrison. This detachment
took part in the successful defence of
Gibraltar against the power of Spain, and when the
siege was raised, it returned to Minorca.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1732<br />1735<br />1742</div>

<p>While the regiment was at Minorca, Colonel Cosby
was succeeded by Sir Charles Hotham, Baronet, in
1732; and, in 1735, King George II. nominated
Colonel John Armstrong to the colonelcy. This officer,
dying in 1742, was succeeded by Colonel John Mordaunt,
from the forty-seventh regiment.</p>

<p>In the same year, the <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span> regiment was
relieved from duty at Minorca, and returned to
England: it landed at Portsmouth and Southampton,
and marched to Taunton, and the neighbouring towns,
where it passed the winter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1743</div>

<p>From Taunton the regiment marched, in the spring
of 1743, to Exeter and Plymouth, where it was reviewed
by Lieut.-General Lord Tyrawley.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1744</div>

<p>In the spring of 1744, the regiment marched to
Richmond, and other towns near Hounslow Heath, and
was reviewed by His Royal Highness the Duke of
Cumberland. "The regiment gained great reputation
by its discipline and good appearance, and had the
pleasure of being assured of His Royal Highness'
approbation."<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> After the review, the regiment
marched to Fareham, and mounted guard over the
French and Spanish prisoners at Portchester Castle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1745</div>

<p>At the battle of Fontenoy, the British troops, supporting
the interests of the house of Austria against the
power of France and Bavaria, were repulsed in their
attempts to raise the siege of Tournay, and sustained
severe loss; and the <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span> regiment was ordered
to join the British army in Flanders. The <span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span>
embarked at Gravesend, with a detachment of foot
guards and the fourteenth regiment, landed at Ostend,
and, advancing up the country, joined the army, commanded
by His Royal Highness the Duke of Cumberland,
at the camp at Lessines, in May, 1745. The
French, having a great superiority of numbers, captured
several strong towns, and besieged <em>Ostend</em>, when the
<span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span> were selected to reinforce the garrison of
that fortress. The regiment accordingly marched to
Antwerp, where it embarked on board of Dutch billanders,
in which it sailed to Flushing, where it was
removed on board of transports that conveyed it to
Ostend, which town was found abandoned by the inhabitants,
and besieged by a numerous French force.
The garrison did not exceed three thousand men, a
number very inadequate to the defence of the place;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
the fortifications had been neglected and were out of
repair; and the Austrian governor permitted the enemy
to gain possession of the sluices before he had inundated
the country round the town. The means of a long
defence were wanting, and, after holding out until the
ammunition was nearly expended, and the guns of the
fortress dismounted, the governor capitulated, on condition
that the garrison should march to the quarters of
the allied army. The writer of the continuation of General
Stearne's journal complains of the treacherous conduct
of the French on this occasion, in causing the garrison
to make a considerable détour, employing agents to
induce, by promises of reward, the soldiers to desert,
and, after a march of twenty miles in one day, delivering
the garrison up at a frontier village cantonment
about seven in the evening, and having a numerous
force ready to cut off the fatigued men at an early
hour on the following morning. This was, however,
defeated; the Duke of Cumberland sent a General
officer to take charge of the troops on their arrival,
and, instead of allowing the tired soldiers to go into
quarters, he ordered them to load their muskets, fix
their bayonets, and march for Mons. The writer, before
alluded to, states, "As we every moment expected the
enemy, we continued our march in the greatest
order; not a whisper was to be heard: the officers who
were present will always remember with pleasure
the discipline and good disposition every regiment
showed on that occasion." ... "So narrow was our
escape, that the French got to their ground within
an hour of our passing it, and we saw them in the
morning encamped about two miles from Mons."</p>

<p>The <span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span> regiment, and other corps from
Ostend, remained at Mons about three weeks, watched
by a numerous French force; but on the approach of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
detachment from the allied army, the enemy retired:
the regiments then marched out at midnight, arrived
at Charleroi on the following day, and afterwards joined
the army near Brussels.</p>

<p>In the autumn of this year, Charles Edward, eldest
son of the Pretender, raised the standard of his father
in Scotland, and, being joined by a number of Highland
clans, penetrated into England. On this occasion the
<span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span> regiment marched to Williamstadt, where
it embarked for England, and, arriving at Gravesend
on the 5th of November, landed and joined the camp
at Dartford, where it remained several weeks, and lost
the surgeon and a number of men from diseases produced
by being exposed to severe weather in a camp
in the winter months.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1746</div>

<p>The regiment returned to Gravesend in March, 1746,
and embarked for Scotland, with the twelfth, sixteenth,
and twenty-fourth foot. These corps arrived at Leith
on the 19th of April, as the guns of Edinburgh castle
were firing for the victory gained over the rebels at
Culloden, and this terminated the rebellion.</p>

<p>The regiment waited at Leith until the return of an
express from the army, when it received orders to sail
northward; it landed at Nairn on the 1st of May, was cantoned
in the neighbourhood of that place three weeks,
and afterwards joined the army at Inverness, at which
place the regiment was encamped until the autumn,
when it marched into quarters at Nairn, Elgin, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1747</div>

<p>In the summer of 1747, the regiment marched to
Fort Augustus, and encamped among the mountains
near that place, under the orders of Major-General
Blakeney, until October, when it marched to Edinburgh
castle, and Stirling.</p>

<p>Major-General Sir John Mordaunt was removed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
the twelfth dragoons in December of this year, and
was succeeded in the colonelcy by Colonel John Folliott,
from the sixty-first foot, a newly-raised corps, afterwards
disbanded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1748<br />1749<br />1750</div>

<p>Returning to England in the spring of 1748, the
regiment was stationed at Berwick, Newcastle, and
Carlisle, where it remained until the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle,
when it marched to Glasgow, and embarked
for Ireland on the 18th of February, 1749. It was
stationed at Enniskillen and Ballyshannon twelve
months, and was removed in 1750 to Kinsale, and in
1751 to Cork.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1751</div>

<p>In the Royal warrant of the 1st of July, 1751, the
uniform of the regiment is directed to be scarlet, faced
with blue. The First, or King's colour, to be the great
union; the Second, or regimental colour, to be of blue
silk with the union in the upper canton; in the centre
of the colour, the <span class="smcap">Harp</span> in a blue field and the <span class="smcap">Crown</span>
over it; and in the three corners of the colour, the
<span class="smcap">Lion of Nassau</span>, the arms of King William III. On
the grenadier caps, the <span class="smcap">Harp and Crown</span>, as on the
colours. The <span class="smcap">Harp and Crown</span> to be painted in
the same manner on the drums and bells of arms,
with the rank of the regiment underneath.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<div class="sidenotex">1752<br />1753<br />1754</div>

<p>From Cork the regiment marched, in 1752, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Waterford; in 1753 it proceeded to Dublin, and in
1754 to Londonderry and Ballyshannon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1755</div>

<p>Disputes having arisen between Great Britain and
France, respecting the extent of the British territories
in North America, hostilities commenced, and the
regiment was suddenly ordered to England in the
spring of 1755. It landed at Liverpool on Easter
Sunday, the 3rd of April, and marched to Berwick,
where the establishment was augmented to seventy-eight
men per company, and two companies were
afterwards added: in October the regiment marched
to Edinburgh, where it was stationed during the
winter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1756</div>

<p>In February, 1756, the two additional companies were
incorporated in the fifty-sixth regiment, then newly
raised; and in May the <span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span> were reviewed by
Lieut.-General Bland, commanding the forces in North
Britain, and afterwards marched to Fort William, with
numerous detachments at various posts in the Highlands.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1757</div>

<p>Orders were received in February, 1757, for the
regiment to proceed to Ireland, and it was stationed
in that part of the United Kingdom during the
remainder of the seven years' war.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1762</div>

<p>Lieut.-General Folliott died in January, 1762, and
in April King George III. conferred the colonelcy of
the <span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span> regiment on Major-General Sir John
Sebright, Bart., from the eighty-third foot, which corps
was disbanded in 1763.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1767<br />1775</div>

<p>In 1767 the <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span> regiment proceeded from
Ireland to North America, where it was stationed when
the unfortunate misunderstanding occurred between
Great Britain and her North American colonies on
the subject of taxation. The Americans manifested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
a disposition to violence, and three companies of the
<span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span> were stationed at Boston, the capital of
the state of Massachusetts, under the Governor of the
province, General Gage.</p>

<p>General Gage, having ascertained that the Americans
had collected a quantity of military stores at <em>Concord</em>,
detached the grenadiers and light infantry, including
the companies of the <span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span>, to effect the destruction
of these stores. These companies embarked in
boats, under Colonel Smith, of the tenth, on the
evening of the 18th of April, 1775, and sailed up
Charles river to the marshes of Cambridge, where they
landed and marched towards Concord. At the
village of <em>Lexington</em> they were opposed by a party of
American militia; some firing occurred, and several
men were killed and wounded: thus the first blood
was spilt, and open resistance followed. The King's
troops continued their march to Concord, and effected
the destruction of the stores. In the meantime the
country had been alarmed for many miles, and, when
the soldiers commenced their journey back to Boston,
they were fired upon from behind the walls, trees, fences,
barns, &amp;c., on both sides of the road, and skirmish
succeeded skirmish until they arrived at Lexington,
where they were met by Earl Percy's brigade, with
two field-pieces. The fire of the artillery checked the
Americans, and the troops continued their march to
Boston. The flank companies of the <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span>
regiment had two men killed and four wounded on this
occasion.</p>

<p>This open resistance to legal authority was followed
by the appearance of multitudes of armed
Americans in the neighbourhood of Boston, and on
the night of the 16th of June they commenced throw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>ing
up entrenchments on the peninsula of Charleston,
on a height called <em>Bunker's Hill</em>; and on the
following day General Gage detached a body of
troops, of which the flank companies of the <span class="fs70">ROYAL
IRISH</span> regiment formed part, to drive the Americans
from the hill. The attack was made about three o'clock
in the afternoon, and British valour was conspicuously
displayed; but the Americans had a great superiority
of numbers and a strong post. The King's troops
were twice arrested in their progress, but by a determined
effort they carried the height at the point
of the bayonet, and triumphed over thrice their own
numbers. The loss of the <span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span> was limited
to three rank and file killed, Lieutenant William
Richardson and seven rank and file wounded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1776</div>

<p>Although the valour and discipline of the British
corps in North America were so conspicuous as to
excite the admiration of their country, yet the few
corps at Boston were beset by such multitudes of
opponents, that it became impossible for these excellent
qualities to be exercised with any prospect of
ultimate success; and in the middle of March, 1776,
the town was abandoned, the British troops embarking
for Nova Scotia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1777</div>

<p>Soon afterwards the regiment received orders to
transfer its men fit for service to other corps, and
return to Europe: it arrived in England in July,
1776, and was stationed at Dover Castle, where it
remained during the year 1777.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1778</div>

<p>From Dover, the regiment proceeded to Coxheath,
where an encampment was formed of the Royal
Dragoons, five regiments of infantry, and fifteen
battalions of militia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1779</div>

<p>In the summer of 1779, the regiment was encamped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
at Warley, in the Essex district, with three other
corps of regular infantry and ten battalions of militia,
under Lieut.-General Parker.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1780<br />1782</div>

<p>The regiment was encamped at Finchley in 1780,
and afterwards in Hyde Park; and in 1782 it proceeded
to the island of Jersey, where its numbers
were reduced to the peace establishment in consequence
of the termination of the American war.</p>

<p>Leaving Jersey in February, 1782, the thanks of
the Commander of the forces at that station were
conveyed to the officers and soldiers of the <span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span>,
for their conduct while under his command. The
regiment was afterwards stationed at Guernsey, where
an alarming mutiny occurred among the soldiers of the
104th regiment, who fired upon their officers, and took
possession of the fort. They were invested by the
<span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span> regiment, commanded by Major Mawby,
and a battalion of militia, and were forced to submit.
The lieut.-governor thanked the <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span> regiment,
in orders, for its loyal and spirited conduct on this
occasion, in the strongest terms, and promised to take
the earliest opportunity of bringing its meritorious conduct
before the King. The States of the island also
conveyed the expression of their thanks and approbation
of the excellent behaviour of the <span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span> regiment,
accompanied by a vote of 100 guineas, to be divided
among the non-commissioned officers and soldiers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1783</div>

<p>In July, 1783, the regiment proceeded to Portsmouth,
and in October it embarked for the fortress of Gibraltar.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1793</div>

<p>While the <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span> regiment was employed in
protecting the important fortress of Gibraltar, a revolution
occurred in France; Louis XVI. was beheaded
by his subjects in 1793; and while anarchy and blood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>shed
prevailed in France, the republicans of that
country sought to involve other nations in the same
calamities. War was the result. A powerful party
favourable to monarchy still existed in France, many
patriots stood forward in the cause of royalty, and the
inhabitants of <em>Toulon</em> joined with Admiral Turgot
in delivering up that port to the British, who took
possession of the place in the name of Louis XVII.
A numerous republican army advanced against Toulon,
and the allies made exertions to procure troops for the
defence of the town and harbour. Some corps of
French loyalists were embodied; detachments of
Spaniards, Neapolitans, and Sardinians were procured,
and the <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span> regiment was withdrawn from
Gibraltar to aid in the protection of this important
place.</p>

<p>The regiment arrived at Toulon in November, and
was actively employed in the defence of the place
upwards of a month, during which period it was frequently
engaged with the republican troops of France.</p>

<p>A battery having been erected by the enemy on the
heights of <em>Arenes</em>, which much annoyed one of the
principal outposts, a party of the <span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span> joined
the troops under Major-General David Dundas, which
issued from Toulon on the morning of the 30th of
November, crossed the river, traversed olive-grounds,
intersected with stone walls, ascended a height cut into
vine-terraces, and, surprising the French on their post,
drove them from the battery with signal gallantry.
The object in view was thus accomplished, but the
impetuosity of the soldiers could not be restrained;
they pursued the enemy too far, and, encountering
fresh adversaries, were forced to retire with loss. The
<span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span> regiment had seven men killed on this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
occasion, twenty-four wounded, four serjeants, one
drummer, and twenty-nine rank and file missing.</p>

<p>Much difficulty was experienced in defending Toulon
with twelve thousand men, of five different nations,
against thirty to forty thousand French troops;
a circumference of fifteen miles having to be occupied
by a number of posts which required nine
thousand men for their protection, so that three-fourths
of the men were constantly on duty. On the 17th of
December, the French attacked the British quarter
under Captain William Conolly of the <span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span>, who
defended his post with great gallantry until the enemy
had forced the Spanish side, when he fell back fighting
to another position. The regiment lost Ensign George
Minchin and two rank and file on this occasion. The
enemy afterwards attacked the posts on the mountain
of Pharou, where another party of the <span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span> was
engaged, and lost one serjeant and five rank and file.</p>

<p>The line of posts being forced, it was found impossible
to preserve the town and harbour, and the French
shipping, arsenal, and magazines were set on fire, and
the troops of the several nations embarked on board of
the fleet on the 19th of December.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1794</div>

<p>After the evacuation of Toulon, the fleet proceeded
to the bay of Hières, and arrangements were made for
attacking the island of <em>Corsica</em>: the fleet weighed anchor
on the 24th of January, 1794; but was dispersed by a
gale of wind. Early in February a landing was effected
in the gulf of Fiorenzo in the island of Corsica, and a
series of operations were commenced by which the
greater part of the island was speedily reduced, and an
assembly of Deputies afterwards agreed to unite Corsica
to the British dominions.</p>

<p>The fortified town of <em>Calvi</em>, situate on a tongue of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
land which forms a beautiful harbour thirty-three miles
from <em>Bastia</em>, the capital of Corsica, still held out in the
French interest, and the <span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span> regiment, commanded
by Lieut.-Colonel David Douglas Wemyss,
was selected to join the troops, under Lieut.-General
C. Stuart, appointed for the reduction of this fortress.
The regiment accordingly sailed from Bastia, and,
having landed near Calvi on the 19th of June, took
post on a ridge of mountains three miles from the town.
Owing to the numerous rocky heights and steep acclivities
before the town, the soldiers and seamen had to
make roads along difficult precipices, to drag guns up
the mountains, and to carry up materials for erecting
the batteries, which they performed with cheerfulness.
A practical breach having been made in the west side
of the Mozello, on the 18th of July the light infantry
(including the light company of the <span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span>) and
the second battalion of the Royals, commanded by
Lieut.-Colonel Moore, "proceeded with a cool steady
confidence, and unloaded arms, towards the enemy,
forced their way through a smart fire of musketry,
and, regardless of live shells flung into the breach, or
the additional defence of pikes, stormed the Mozello;
while Lieut.-Colonel Wemyss, with the <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span>
regiment, and two pieces of cannon under the direction
of Lieutenant Lemoine of the royal artillery, equally
regardless of opposition, carried the enemy's battery
on the left, and forced the trenches without firing a
shot."<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>After the capture of these important posts, the siege
of Calvi was prosecuted with vigour, and on the 10th
of August the garrison surrendered.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>
<p>The loss of the <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span> regiment was limited
to six rank and file killed; Lieutenant William
Johnston, one serjeant, and ten rank and file
wounded.</p>

<p>In the early part of this year, General Sir John
Sebright, Bart., died; and the colonelcy of the regiment
was conferred on Major-General Sir James Murray,
Bart., who afterwards took the surname of Pulteney.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1795<br />1796</div>

<p>The <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span> regiment was stationed in the
island of Corsica during the year 1795, and nine
months of 1796. In the mean time the success of the
French arms, particularly the brilliant career of General
Bonaparte in Italy, had produced a change of
sentiment among the inhabitants of Corsica. Bonaparte
was a native of the island; the Corsicans gloried in him
as a man who reflected honour on their country, and they
regretted that the island had become annexed to Great
Britain, as this event placed them in hostility to their
victorious countryman, and they began to plot measures
to effect its separation. It appearing evident that the
expense of the defence would exceed the advantage
derived from the possession of the island, the British
troops were withdrawn in October, and the <span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span>
proceeded to the island of Elba.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1797<br />1798<br />1799</div>

<p>Soon afterwards the regiment was detached, with a
small force under Colonel Wemyss, to the coast of Italy;
the troops landed on the 7th of November, and, having
driven the French from the principality of Piombino,
occupied the towns of Campiglia, Castiglione, and
Piombino, with some advanced posts in the Tuscan
states. The <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span> were commanded by Lieut.-Colonel
H. T. Montresor, and distinguished themselves
on several occasions. They waded through an inundation
of near three miles, to attack the town of <em>Campiglia</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
and made the French garrison prisoners. The enemy
receiving considerable reinforcements, and advancing
in force against those towns, the British troops were
withdrawn from Italy, and returned to Elba. During
the winter, the <span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span> regiment sailed for
Gibraltar, where it arrived in the beginning of 1797,
and was stationed at that fortress during the two
following years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1800</div>

<p>In the spring of 1800, the regiment was withdrawn
from Gibraltar, to join the armament preparing for
active service in the Mediterranean: it proceeded to
Minorca, where the land-forces were assembled, and in
the summer sailed under the orders of Lieut.-General
Sir Ralph Abercromby for Genoa, to co-operate with
the Austrians; but the victories gained by the French
in Italy occasioned this enterprise to be abandoned,
and the <span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span> returned to Minorca.</p>

<p>The regiment afterwards sailed with the expedition
against <em>Cadiz</em>, and it had entered the boats of the
fleet for the purpose of effecting a landing and attacking
Cadiz, when orders were received to return on
board the shipping; the attack of this place having
been relinquished in consequence of an infectious disease
of a fatal character ravaging the city; and the armament
sailed to Gibraltar.</p>

<p>After some delay, the <span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span> regiment again
proceeded to Minorca.</p>

<p>In the meantime a powerful French army had taken
possession of Egypt, with the view of colonizing that
country, and making it the base of future conquests
in the east, and the <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span> regiment was called
from Minorca to take part in the expulsion of the
boasted invincible legions of France from Egypt. The
regiment accordingly quitted Minorca without landing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
and sailed to Malta, where it joined the armament under
Lieut.-General Sir Ralph Abercromby, and was formed
in brigade with the thirtieth, forty-fourth, and eighty-ninth,
under the orders of Brigadier-General Doyle.
The troops were soon restored and reanimated, after
having been so long at sea, by the abundance of fresh
provisions which the island of Malta afforded, and the
comforts of the beautiful city of Valetta, and on the
20th of December the fleet sailed for the bay of Marmorice,
in Asiatic Turkey, where it arrived in nine days.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1801</div>

<p>In this bay, environed by mountains covered with the
foliage of trees, the troops remained several weeks,
while preparations were being completed, and a plan
of co-operation was arranged with the Turks, whose
tardy proceedings detained the expedition some time.
On the 23rd of February, 1801, the fleet again put to
sea, presenting a splendid sight; the magnitude of the
armament, and the gaiety of the brave men on board,
being calculated to excite emotions of an interesting
character. On the 1st of March, the armament arrived
off the celebrated city of Alexandria, and anchored in
the bay of <em>Aboukir</em>.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of the 8th of March, five thousand
British troops entered the boats to effect a landing
in the face of an adverse army, and the <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span>
regiment, having joined the second brigade under Major-General
Cradock, entered some small Greek ships to
be in readiness to support the gallant men who should
first land on the shores of Egypt. A rocket gave the
expected signal, and the clear silence of the morning
was instantly broken by the deep murmur of a
thousand oars urging forward the flower of a brave
army, whose polished arms gleamed in the rays of the
morning sun. Suddenly the thunder of artillery shook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
the ground, and a tempest of balls cut the surface of
the water; but the British soldiers speedily gained
the shore in the face of this tempest of war, and, rushing
forward to close upon their enemies with the bayonet,
soon decided the contest and forced the French to
retreat with loss. The <span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span> regiment, commanded
by Lieut.-Colonel Montresor, was one of the first
corps which landed to support the leading division, and
to participate in this splendid triumph of British valour.</p>

<p>Advancing towards Alexandria, the British troops
encamped near Mandora Tower, and on the 13th of
March they proceeded through a wood of date-trees
to attack the French forces posted on a ridge of heights
in front. The <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span> deployed under a heavy
fire, with the other corps of their brigade, and
executed the manœuvre with admirable order and
precision; and, advancing upon their adversaries, compelled
the French to retire from their position. A
strong body of French cavalry charged the leading
corps of the British right column, but was repulsed.
Under the cover of some sand-hills, a body of French
dragoons rode towards the British second brigade, and
attempted to penetrate the interval between the
<span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span> and the regiment on their left: the French
troopers were checked by a prompt and well-directed
fire from the light company of the <span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span>, which
was followed by a rapid platoon fire from the regiment,
and the French horsemen made a precipitate retreat.
They belonged to the eighteenth French dragoons, and
had been mistaken, by one British battalion, for a
foreign corps in the English service.</p>

<p>The French, having been driven from their post,
fell back to an entrenched position before Alexandria;
and the British, after reconnoitring the ground, en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>camped
in front of the enemy's lines. Speaking of
the conduct of the army, on this occasion, in general
orders, Sir Ralph Abercromby stated that he
felt it "incumbent on him particularly to express
his most perfect satisfaction with the steady and
gallant conduct of Major-General Cradock's brigade."
The conduct of the brigade was also commended
in the General's public despatch.</p>

<p>The loss of the <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span> regiment was Captain
George Jones, killed; three officers, one serjeant, and
forty-five rank and file wounded.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 21st of March, the French
issued from their position, and attacked the British
line; but they encountered an opposition which they
were unable to overcome, and the English army was
once more triumphant over the numerous veteran
troops of France. This action afforded the <span class="fs70">ROYAL
IRISH</span> regiment another opportunity of gaining honour
on the distant shores of Egypt; and its gallant bearing
throughout the day was conspicuous. This victory
was however clouded with the fall of the brave <span class="smcap">Sir
Ralph Abercromby</span>, who died of wounds received in
action. He was succeeded in the command of the
army by Major-General (afterwards Lord) Hutchinson.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards a body of British troops traversed
the country to <em>Rosetta</em>, where a small force of British,
Turks, and Greeks was assembled, and took post at
Hamed. The <span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span> regiment, and two other
corps, followed on the 13th of April, and, after the
surrender of Fort St. Julian, a strong division of the
army advanced up the banks of the Nile, to attack
the French troops in Upper Egypt.</p>

<p>The <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span> regiment took part in the operations
by which the French were driven from <em>El Aft</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
and from the fortified post of <em>Rahmanie</em>, and forced to
retire upon Cairo.</p>

<p>Following the retreating enemy up the country, the
<span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span> arrived, with the army, at the vicinity
of the celebrated pyramids of Egypt, in the early part
of June; and after a halt of several days they advanced
upon the city of <em>Cairo</em>, which was besieged by
the united British and Turkish forces, and in a few
days the garrison surrendered, on condition of being
sent back to France.</p>

<p>The capture of the capital of Egypt added fresh
laurels to the British arms; and the troops which had
acquired these honours retired down the Nile to the
vicinity of <em>Alexandria</em>, and, having driven in the French
outposts, commenced the siege of that place with vigour.
In the beginning of September, the garrison surrendered,
on condition of being sent back to France.</p>

<p>Thus was Egypt delivered from the power of France;
and the British troops, which overcame the boasted
<em>invincible</em> legions of Bonaparte, and forced the <em>Army of
the East</em> to surrender its conquests, were rewarded with
the thanks of Parliament, the approbation of their
Sovereign, and the royal authority to bear on their
colours the "<span class="smcap">Sphinx</span>," with the word "<span class="smcap">Egypt</span>;" and
the officers were permitted to receive gold medals from
the Grand Seignior.</p>

<p>Immediately after the conquest of Egypt, the British
generals and admirals endeavoured to promote still
further the interests of their country by preparing to
make additional acquisitions, and the <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span>
regiment was one of the corps selected to proceed on
another expedition. Several corps sailed on the 12th
of September; but were met at sea by a ship of war
bringing information that the preliminaries of a treaty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
of peace were signed; the troops proceeded to Malta,
where the <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span> regiment arrived in October.</p>

<p>After performing garrison duty at Valetta for
six weeks, the regiment proceeded to the island of
Elba, and occupied the fortress of Porto Ferrajo, the
French being in possession of other parts of the
island.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1802</div>

<p>The treaty of Amiens being concluded, the regiment
sailed for Ireland in the summer of 1802, and after
landing at Cork proceeded to Armagh.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1803</div>

<p>War was resumed in 1803, and in the summer of
that year the regiment marched to Newry, where it
was augmented to <em>two battalions</em>, from the army of
reserve. Both battalions were completed to 1100 men
each in less than two months, and in October the first
battalion embarked from Ireland for Scotland; it
landed at Greenock, and proceeded from thence to
Edinburgh. It was followed to Scotland by the second
battalion, which was stationed a short time at Stirling
castle; but on the removal of the first battalion from
Edinburgh to Haddington, the second battalion proceeded
to Dunbar.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1804</div>

<p>The threat of invading England made by Napoleon
Bonaparte, with the progress of the naval preparations
on the coast of France, and the presence of a numerous
French army at Boulogne, occasioned the regiment to
be withdrawn from Scotland in the summer of 1804,
and to proceed to the south of England, to be in
readiness to repel the invaders, should they venture to
land. On quitting Haddington, Lieut.-Colonel Montresor
received a highly gratifying letter from the
magistrates and clergy of that place, expressing their
admiration of the peaceable and regular behaviour of
the non-commissioned officers and soldiers of the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
battalion during their stay at Haddington, and a tribute
of public respect to the officers for their gentlemanly
deportment towards the respectable inhabitants in the
neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Both battalions landed at Ramsgate, and joined the
troops encamped on Barham Downs. On the breaking
up of the camp, the second battalion embarked for the
island of Jersey.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1805</div>

<p>Towards the end of January, the first battalion embarked
for the island of Jamaica, where it arrived in
May.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1807</div>

<p>In 1807 the second battalion proceeded to the
West Indies, and was stationed at the island of
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Curaçoa'">Curaçao</ins>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1808<br />1809</div>

<p>The <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span> regiment being employed in
guarding the colonial possessions of Great Britain, its
services were valuable to the Crown and to the kingdom,
and the exemplary conduct of both battalions was
commended by the general officers under whom the
regiment served; but the performance of this duty
precluded the <span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span> sharing in the brilliant
campaigns of the British army in the Peninsula, where
several corps acquired numerous honorary inscriptions
for their regimental colours.</p>

<p>The first battalion sailed from Jamaica on the 7th
of June, 1809, with the troops under Major-General
Sir Hugh Lyle Carmichael, to aid the Spaniards in
their attempt to reduce the city of <em>St. Domingo</em>. The
British troops landed about thirty miles from the
place, and, advancing to the besieged fortress, found
the Spanish army greatly reduced by sickness. Prompt
measures were adopted for an attack on the place by
storm by the British troops, and the <span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span> were
under arms to take part in this service, when hostilities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
were suddenly terminated by the surrender of the
French garrison.</p>

<p>After the deliverance of the city of St. Domingo
from the power of France, the <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span> returned
to Jamaica.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1810</div>

<p>Very severe losses having been sustained by the
second battalion from the climate of the West Indies,
it was directed to transfer its men fit for service to the
first battalion, and embark for England to recruit. It
arrived at Ottery barracks, in Devonshire, in October
1810, and was joined by the regimental depôt, amounting
to upwards of five hundred men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1811</div>

<p>In the spring of 1811 the second battalion proceeded
to the island of Jersey.</p>

<p>On the decease of General Sir James Pulteney,
Bart., His Royal Highness the Prince Regent conferred
the colonelcy of the <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span> regiment on
Lieut.-General John Lord Hutchinson, K.B., afterwards
Earl of Donoughmore, from the fifty-seventh
regiment, by commission dated the 27th of April,
1811.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1814</div>

<p>The second battalion was employed on garrison duty
in the island of Jersey until the power of Napoleon
Bonaparte was overthrown by the armies of the allies,
and the Bourbon family was restored to the throne of
France, which was accompanied by the restoration of
peace to Europe. A reduction was, in consequence,
made in the strength of the British army, and the
second battalion of the <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span> regiment was
disbanded at Jersey on the 24th of October 1814,
transferring its non-commissioned officers and private
soldiers fit for duty to the first battalion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1817</div>

<p>After twelve years' service in Jamaica, during
which time it had suffered severely from the effects of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
climate, and had lost upwards of fifty officers and
nearly three thousand non-commissioned officers and
soldiers, the <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span> regiment received orders to
return to England. It landed at Portsmouth in March,
1817, in so complete a state of discipline and efficiency,
that it was ordered to proceed to Brighton, where it
had the honour of furnishing the usual guard for the
Prince Regent during His Royal Highness' stay at
the Pavilion. The regiment was afterwards removed
to Chatham and Sheerness, and in August it proceeded
to Hilsea barracks.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1818</div>

<p>Early in 1818 the <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span> regiment marched to
Haslar barracks and Gosport; in December it embarked
for Ireland, and, after landing at Cork, proceeded
to Fermoy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1819</div>

<p>From Fermoy the regiment marched, in January,
1819, to Waterford, Wexford, Carlow, Duncannon-fort,
and Kilkenny; and the excellent conduct of the men,
during their stay in these quarters, elicited the admiration
and gratitude of the public authorities of the
several places, which was communicated to the corps in
the strongest terms.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1820</div>

<p>In July, 1820, the regiment marched to Cork.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1821</div>

<p>Orders having been received for the regiment to
transfer its services to Malta, it embarked from Cork
in February, 1821, and after its arrival on that island
the head-quarters were established in the Cottonera
district, with one company detached to the small island
of Gozo.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1822</div>

<p>In November, 1822, the regiment was removed to St.
Elmo barracks and Valetta, where the detached company
joined from the island of Gozo.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1823</div>

<p>After remaining twelve months at St. Elmo barracks,
the regiment was removed to Floriana barracks in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
November, 1823, detaching two companies to Fort
Manuel and Tignie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1824</div>

<p>On the 8th of May, 1824, the first division of the
regiment embarked from Malta for the Ionian Islands,
and was followed by the head-quarters in June, on
which occasion the following general order, dated
Malta, 18th of June, 1824, was issued:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Marquis of Hastings, having been long acquainted
with the high character of the <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span>
regiment of infantry, cannot suffer that distinguished
corps to quit this island without expressing his
regret at losing its services. The report made to
him, by Major-General Sir Manley Power, of the
uniformly excellent conduct maintained by the officers
and men of the regiment, during their residence here,
authorizes the Marquis of Hastings to request that
they will accept his applause, and his sincere wishes
for their future welfare.</p>

<p class="right padr4">"<em>By command of His Excellency</em>,</p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">"C. Bayley</span>, A.M.S."</p>

<p>The last division of the regiment arrived at Corfu
on the 24th of June, and occupied quarters in the
citadel.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1825</div>

<p>In July, 1825, four companies and the head-quarters
proceeded to Fort Neuf, leaving the remaining companies
in the citadel. In August the regiment was formed
into six service and four depôt companies.</p>

<p>The head-quarters and flank companies returned to
the citadel on the 14th of November, and on the same
day four battalion companies embarked for Santa
Maura, furnishing detachments at Calamas, Magnassia,
Fort Alexandria, San Nicolo, Fort Constantine, Scorpio,
San Nichola, and Vassaliki.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1832</div>

<p>The regiment remained at the Ionian Islands until
February, 1832, when it embarked from Corfu for England,
and landed at Portsmouth on the 7th of March.</p>

<p>The decease of General the Earl of Donoughmore
occurred in the summer of 1832, when King William
IV. appointed Lieut.-General Matthew Lord Aylmer,
K.C.B., from the fifty-sixth foot, to the colonelcy of the
<span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span> regiment, by commission dated 23rd of
July, 1832.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1834<br />1835<br />1836</div>

<p>The regiment remained in England until May, 1834,
when it embarked from Liverpool, and, landing at
Dublin, was stationed in Ireland nearly three years,
during which period it preserved its high character.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1837</div>

<p>Having received orders to transfer its services to
the British possessions in Asia, the <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span> regiment
was divided into six service and four depôt
companies, and on the 10th of January, 1837, the
service companies embarked for Ceylon, under the
orders of Colonel George Burrell: they landed at
Colombo on the 1st of June, and were stationed at
that place and at Galle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1838</div>

<p>In the autumn of 1838 the depôt companies embarked
from Dublin, and, landing at Portsmouth, were
stationed in South Britain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1839</div>

<p>The service companies remained at Colombo and
Galle until February, 1839, when a change of quarters
took place, and they were stationed at Trincomalee
and Galle, where they continued until March of the
following year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1840</div>

<p>In the mean time a course of violence and spoliation
had been commenced by the Chinese government
against the persons and property of the British merchants
trading with that empire, in consequence of the
introduction of opium into China, which was prohibited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
by the Chinese laws, but was tacitly admitted by the
local authorities, who did not enforce the law. At
length, however, the Chinese authorities commenced
summary measures without sufficient previous notice,
and the British superintendents of trade found it
necessary to apply to the Governor-General of India
for a number of ships of war and armed vessels for
the protection of life and property. The violence of
the Chinese, however, could not be restrained by reason
or menace, but the thunder of British artillery was
necessary to enforce forbearance.</p>

<p>The British government found it necessary to send
an expedition to the Chinese seas, to compel the
government of the "Celestial empire" to acknowledge
the principles of international law, as adopted by
civilized nations, and the <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span> regiment was
one of the corps selected for this service. Three
companies from the depôt embarked from Portsmouth
in October, 1839, and arrived at Bombay in March,
1840, and they afterwards sailed for China: three
companies embarked from Trincomalee in May, and
three from Galle in June, and sailed for the Chinese
seas.</p>

<p>Hostilities having been found unavoidable, it became
important to gain possession of a portion of the Chinese
territory, and the governor of <em>Chusan</em>, an island lying
off the coast, and comprising in its jurisdiction a small
group of islands, was summoned to surrender in the
beginning of July. He, however, made dispositions to
defend the place, and on the morning of the 5th of
July the shore was crowded with Chinese troops, and
the landing place, wharf, and adjoining hill displayed
an array of military power. The British shipping
silenced the enemy's war-junks and batteries; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
right wing of the <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span> regiment, commanded
by Major Henry William Adams, with the Royal
Marines of the fleet, forming the advance, landed. They
were followed by other corps, and the British troops,
commanded by Brigadier-General George Burrell,
Lieut.-Colonel of the <span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span>, took up a position
in front of the fortified city of <em>Ting-hae-hien</em>, from whence
a sharp fire was kept up for some time; but before
the following day the Chinese soldiers fled in a panic.
The city was taken possession of, and this success gave
presage of future conquests; but the climate proved
injurious to the health of the troops, and many soldiers
died.</p>

<p>This display of British prowess was followed by
negotiations; and in August the other three companies
of the regiment landed on the island of Chusan, a
detachment taking post at Tsin-Kong.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1841</div>

<p>The tardy councils of the Chinese were expedited by
the activity of the British naval force, and in the early
part of 1841 they agreed to give up the island of Hong-Kong,
pay an indemnity of six million dollars, and open
a direct intercourse for trading upon an equal footing.
The detachment of the <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span> stationed at Tsin-Kong
joined the head-quarters, and on the 17th of
February the regiment embarked for Hong-Kong,
where it arrived in seven days, and the island was
taken possession of; but the Chinese authorities appeared
by their conduct to have no intention of fulfilling
the other stipulations of the treaty. Hostilities
were in consequence resumed, and the <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span>
regiment sailed with the expedition up the Canton
river. The fleet silenced the batteries of <em>Wantong</em>,
and a body of troops landing, the island was captured
without the loss of a man, thirteen hundred Chinese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
soldiers surrendering prisoners of war. Continuing
the voyage up the river, the fleet arrived at the bar,
destroyed the enemy's war-junks, and the works were
stormed and captured by the Marines, &amp;c. As
the expedition pursued its voyage up the river, the
Chinese abandoned several batteries and armed rafts,
and solicited terms of peace; but procrastination
appeared to be their only object, and the British fleet
advanced. The forts in front of <em>Canton</em> soon fell
under the fire of British artillery, the Chinese flotilla
was destroyed, and terms of peace were again solicited
by the authorities of the "Celestial empire." While
negotiations were pending, bodies of Tartar troops
were arriving at <em>Canton</em>, which exposed the object of
the enemy; and on the 24th of May the <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span>
regiment and other British troops landed. On the
following day they advanced against the fortified
heights on the north of the city, and dispositions were
made for the attack, when the <span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span>, commanded
by Lieut.-Colonel Adams, supported by the Royal
Marines, the whole under Major-General Burrell, were
directed to carry a hill in their front.</p>

<p>Major-General Sir Hugh Gough stated in his
public despatch,&mdash;"About half past nine o'clock the
advance was sounded, and it has seldom fallen to
my lot to witness a more soldierlike and steady
advance, or a more animated attack. Every individual,
native as well as European, steadily and
gallantly did his duty. The <span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span> and forty-ninth
were emulous which should first reach their
appointed goals; but under this impulse, they did
not lose sight of that discipline which could alone
ensure success."</p>

<p>The heights were carried by a spirited effort, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
British colours waved triumphantly on the captured
forts, and the soldiers looked down on Canton within a
hundred paces of its walls.</p>

<p>A fortified Chinese camp had been established on the
high ground on the north-east of the city, and from this
camp bodies of the enemy advanced against the
British troops. The <span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span>, forty-ninth, and a
company of Marines, met and repulsed the principal
attack, and, following the fugitives along a causeway,
stormed and captured the entrenched camp in gallant
style. Major-General Sir Hugh Gough stated in his
despatch,&mdash;"I have to record my approval of the
spirited conduct of Captain <span class="smcap">John Grattan</span>, who
commanded the two leading companies of the
<span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span> across the causeway." The camp was
burnt, and the magazines were destroyed.</p>

<p>On the following morning a flag of truce was seen on
the walls, and hostilities were suspended; but procrastination
still appearing to be the object of the Chinese,
preparations were made to attack the city by storm, and
the <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span> were under arms waiting for the signal
to rush forward and achieve the conquest of the celebrated
city of Canton, when an agreement to terms
suddenly prevented further hostilities, the Chinese
paying six millions of dollars for the redemption of
Canton, and opening the port for trade.</p>

<p>The <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span> regiment, commanded by Lieut.-Colonel
Henry William Adams, had two men killed;
Captain John James Sargent, Lieutenants George
Hilliard and David Edwards, and sixteen men
wounded.</p>

<p>On the 2nd of June, the regiment embarked for the
ceded island of <span class="smcap">Hong-Kong</span>, where it arrived in a few
days; and this station proving healthy and convenient,
works were constructed for its protection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>The Emperor of China disregarded the stipulations
of treaties, and issued a mandate for the extermination
of the English who dared thus to insult his coasts and
capture his towns, offering, at the same time, immense
rewards for the heads of the British commanders, and
even a large sum for the head of a private soldier.
His decrees were responded to by depriving him of a
greater extent of territory; and on the 22nd of August
the <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span> sailed on an expedition against the
island and city of <em>Amoy</em>, situate in a fine gulf in the
province of Fokien, the great tea district of China.
On the 25th of August the fleet arrived before Amoy,
which was defended by five hundred pieces of cannon
and a numerous force; but nothing could withstand
the combined efforts of the British naval and land
force. On the following day the works were bombarded
two hours. The <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span> landed about three
o'clock, with little opposition, and escaladed a castellated
wall with great gallantry. They were speedily
within the works, and afterwards charged up a precipitous
gorge in the face of two posts of defence, and
rushing forward with great gallantry, the Chinese
and Tartar soldiers fled in dismay, after firing a few
shots. The regiment remained on the heights above
the city during the night; and on the following morning
the troops advanced towards the wall. No resistance
was made, the advance of the <span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span>
escaladed the walls,&mdash;opened the gates,&mdash;and the city
was taken possession of. The small island of <em>Koolangsoo</em>
was captured on the preceding day. The loss of the
regiment was limited to two men wounded.</p>

<p>On the 5th of September, the regiment sailed with
the expedition for the recapture of <em>Chusan</em>, which
island had been given up in consequence of the stipulations
of the first treaty. The place was found more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
strongly fortified than before, and a resolute stand was
made by the Chinese; but British skill and valour
prevailed. The <span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span> landed on the 1st of
October, stormed the enemy's works with great
gallantry, under Lieut.-Colonel Adams, and occupied
the Joss-house hill, Captain Francis Wigston particularly
distinguishing himself at the head of the
grenadier company of the regiment. The <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span>
afterwards entered the city of Ting-hae-hien at the
western gate, and the British colours were speedily
planted in triumph on the walls. The regiment had one
serjeant and six rank and file wounded on this occasion.</p>

<p>On the following day the regiment traversed the
island to Tsin-kong, and afterwards proceeded to
Sahoo; but returned to Ting-hae-hien on the 4th of
October, and on the 6th embarked with the expedition
against the city of <em>Chinhae</em>, the military depôt of the
province, situate on the mainland opposite Chusan,
and surrounded by a wall of extraordinary height and
thickness. The troops landed on the 10th of October,
advanced through a difficult country towards the city,
and stormed the works covering the approach to the
place, overthrowing all opposition. "The <span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span>
charged up a deep gorge to the left, and broke
through the central encampment, carrying everything
before them."<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> The city was captured, and in
it was an extensive arsenal, and cannon foundry, with
military stores. The <span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span> crossed the river and
entered the city on the same evening: their loss was
one man killed and three wounded.</p>

<p>From Chinhae the <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span> proceeded up the
river on the 13th of October, against the fortified city<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
of <em>Ningpo</em>, where no resistance was met with. The
troops landed and formed on the ramparts, the band of
the <span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span> playing "God save the Queen," and
they took possession of the second city in the province of
Che-Keang, containing a population of three hundred
thousand souls. The regiment was afterwards stationed
in the city of Ningpo some time; and the Chinese
having garrisoned several forts up the river, the flank
companies embarked on the 27th of December, with an
expedition to dislodge the Chinese and Tartar soldiers
from their posts, but the enemy fled without waiting to
be attacked, and the companies returned to Ningpo.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1842</div>

<p>The flank companies proceeded to You-You on the
10th of January, 1842, and were engaged in routing
the enemy, and destroying their encampment the day
following.</p>

<p>During the first three months of the year 1842, four
companies of the regiment were stationed at the city
of Ningpo, under Major Nicholas R. Tomlinson, and five
companies at Koolangsoo, under Major Jeremiah
Cowper.</p>

<p>On the 10th of March a numerous army of Tartars
and Chinese made a sudden attack upon <em>Ningpo</em>, escalading
the walls, and forcing some of the gates, with
great spirit, and the few British forces in garrison were
enveloped by crowds of assailants; but the bravery of
the British was conspicuous, and they triumphed over
their numerous opponents. A guard of the regiment,
consisting of Lieutenant Anthony W. S. F. Armstrong,
one serjeant, and twenty-three rank and file, stationed
at the West-gate, being attacked by large numbers,
behaved steadily, and gallantly drove the enemy back,
capturing two banners, the bearers of which had
been shot at the gate: the spirited behaviour of Lieu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>tenant
Armstrong was commended in the public despatches.</p>

<p>Five days afterwards, the <span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span> embarked
from Ningpo, and sailed up the river to attack the
enemy's posts. On the 15th of March they were
engaged at <em>Tsekee</em>, and the heights of <em>Segaon</em>, which
were captured; and the <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span> also took part in
forcing the <em>Chankee-pass</em>: they returned to Ningpo on
the 17th of March.</p>

<p>Three companies of the <span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span> were withdrawn
from Koolangsoo at the end of March, and proceeded
in a steam-vessel to Ningpo, to reinforce the garrison:
in April two companies proceeded from Ningpo to
Chinhae. One company was afterwards withdrawn
from Chinhae and five from Ningpo, to take part in
the expedition against the fortified city of <em>Chapoo</em>, under
the command of Lieut.-Colonel Tomlinson. A landing
was effected on the 18th of May; British prowess was
again conspicuous, and the <span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span> were distinguished
for their heroic bearing at the attack and
capture of this place, on which occasion Lieut.-Colonel
<span class="smcap">Nicholas R. Tomlinson</span> fell at the head of the regiment,
"in full career of renown, honoured by the
corps, and lamented by all."<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>The loss of the regiment at the capture of this place
was Lieut.-Colonel Tomlinson, one serjeant, and three
rank and file killed; Lieutenants Edward Jodrell and
Alexander Murray, one serjeant, one drummer, and
twenty-seven rank and file wounded. Major Jeremiah
Cowper was promoted to the rank of Lieut.-Colonel on
the 19th May, 1842, in succession to Lieut.-Colonel
Tomlinson; and Brevet Major John Grattan received
the Majority. These brilliant successes had taught the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Chinese the true character of British skill, spirit of
enterprise, and valour, yet, with unaccountable infatuation,
the authorities of the "Celestial empire" still
looked for success, and their resistance gave the
<span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span> opportunities of gaining additional
honours. In June six companies of the regiment were
employed in an expedition up the Yangtse-Keang
river, and took part in the capture of the fortified post
of <em>Woosung</em>, and also in the capture of <em>Poonshau</em>; they
afterwards advanced against the city of <em>Shanghae</em>, which
was taken possession of without opposition.</p>

<p>The company of the regiment stationed at Chinhae
was withdrawn to take part in active operations, and
seven companies sailed with the expedition to carry on
operations against <em>Chin-Keang-foo</em>, one of the strongest
and most important cities of China. To proceed on
this enterprise the fleet left Woosung on the 6th of
July, the Chinese troops were driven from <em>Suyshan</em>,
and on the 20th of July the armament approached
Chin-Keang-foo. A landing was effected, and the
<span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span> evinced the same intrepidity and valour
in the attack of the enemy's entrenched camp, and at
the capture of the city by storm, on the 21st of July,
for which they had previously been distinguished.
On passing through the city and suburbs, the troops
witnessed the painful spectacle of hundreds of the dead
bodies of men, women, and children, lying in the houses,
numerous families having destroyed themselves
sooner than outlive the disgrace of their city being
captured by foreigners.</p>

<p>The <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span> regiment had Captain Charles
J. Russell Collinson and two soldiers killed; Lieutenant
Scroope Bernard, one serjeant, and fifteen rank
and file wounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>This brilliant success of the British arms filled the
Chinese empire with consternation and dismay, and the
English General prepared to carry his victorious troops
into the heart of the empire, and attack <em>Nankin</em>, the
ancient capital of China, to which place the fugitives
from Chin-Keang-foo had fled for refuge. Embarking
on the 29th of July to carry out this important
object, the armament proceeded against the celebrated
city of Nankin, where the <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span> and other corps
arrived on the 9th of August, when a great portion of
the troops landed, and the ancient capital of China
was environed by the British naval and land forces.
This decisive step produced the desired results; the
court of China could no longer hope that its legions
would eventually arrest the victorious career of the
British arms, and conditions of peace were acceded to;
the Chinese paying an indemnity, and ceding a portion
of territory to the British crown.</p>

<p>Thus terminated a war in which the <span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span>,
or the <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span>, regiment, had acquired additional
reputation; a hostile nation had been impressed with
a just sense of the capabilities of the English arms;
and important commercial and national advantages
had been acquired for the British empire.</p>

<p>Her Majesty, in consideration of the gallantry displayed
by the troops employed on the coasts and rivers
of China, was graciously pleased to permit the
<span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span> (<span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span>), twenty-sixth, forty-ninth,
fifty-fifth, and ninety-eighth regiments, and Royal
Artillery, to bear on their colours and appointments
the word "<em>China</em>," and the device of the "<em>Dragon</em>,"
in commemoration of their distinguished services.</p>

<p>After the termination of the contest, the <span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span>
sailed from Nankin to the island of Chusan, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
they arrived in October: the head-quarters sailed for
Koolangsoo on the 17th of November, leaving four
companies of the regiment at Chusan.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1843</div>

<p>The regiment remained at Koolangsoo during the
year 1843.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1844</div>

<p>On the 1st of April the light company embarked at
Koolangsoo, and arrived at Chusan on the 10th of
that month. The head-quarters proceeded from
Koolangsoo to Chusan in the middle of May, and
remained there during the year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1845</div>

<p>The head-quarters of the regiment proceeded from
Chusan to Hong Kong on the 22nd of February: the
left wing arrived at Hong Kong from Chusan on the
12th of May.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1846</div>

<p>During the year 1846 the regiment remained at
Hong Kong.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1847</div>

<p>The head-quarters, consisting of twenty-four officers,
thirty-four serjeants, seven drummers, and four hundred
and sixty-eight rank and file, embarked at Hong
Kong for active service on the 1st of April, 1847, and
were employed during the combined naval and military
operations on the Canton river under Major-General
D'Aguilar, C.B., and returned to Hong Kong on the
morning of the 9th of April, 1847, leaving a detachment
at Canton of three officers, six serjeants, and
sixty-two men, which returned to Hong Kong on the
2nd of June following.</p>

<p>The regiment, consisting of twenty-five officers and
six hundred and fifty-two men, embarked at Hong
Kong for Calcutta on the 20th of November, 1847.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1848</div>

<p>The regiment arrived at Calcutta on the 10th of
January, 1848, and occupied the barracks at Fort
William, where it continued to be stationed on the 1st
of June, 1848, at which period the record is concluded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>The foregoing pages, after diligent research, contain,
as far as possible, a faithful detail of the services of
the <span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH, ROYAL IRISH, REGIMENT OF FOOT</span>.</p>

<p>The career of this highly honorable corps can only
be appreciated as a public body, and as a portion
of the military force of the British empire, after a
perusal of its gallant deeds in the various situations
and services on which it has been employed.</p>

<p>The circumstance of its first formation in the reign
of King Charles II.,&mdash;of its adhesion to King James II.
on his succeeding to the British throne in 1685,&mdash;and
of the severe test to which the army was exposed at the
Revolution in 1688,&mdash;all prove the value of the corps,
and the difficulties with which its principal officers had
to contend at a period when the English nation was
endeavouring to rid itself of a sovereign of Popish
principles, and to establish a Protestant Government.</p>

<p>The decided conduct of the <span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH, ROYAL
IRISH</span>, regiment on the commencement of the Revolution
in 1688, and throughout the contest in Ireland
until 1691, evinced a steady loyalty and determination,
on which King William III. found he could rely.</p>

<p>The same confidence was placed in this regiment
by King William during the campaigns in Flanders
from 1691 to 1697, for which the most distinguished
honours were conferred by His Majesty on the corps
on account of its heroic services.</p>

<p>In the war of the Spanish Succession, during the
reign of Queen Anne, from 1702 to 1712, the <span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH,
ROYAL IRISH</span>, regiment is recorded as having
shared in the numerous sieges and victories under the
Duke of Marlborough, as detailed in the Regimental
Record.</p>

<p>After the cessation of hostilities by the Treaty of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Utrecht, in 1713, the services of the regiment were
equally efficient and useful in the British possessions,
particularly at the island of Minorca, from whence it
proceeded in 1727 to Gibraltar, when the Spaniards
again besieged that fortress.</p>

<p>The <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH REGIMENT</span> was again employed in
Flanders during the war of the Austrian Succession,
from 1743 to 1748.</p>

<p>The regiment shared also in the arduous duties of
the British troops employed during the early part of
the American war, which commenced in 1775.</p>

<p>The next important service on which the <span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH,
ROYAL IRISH</span>, regiment was engaged, was the ever-memorable
campaign of the British army in Egypt,
which succeeded in repelling from that country the
French army, which had vainly styled itself "invincible,"
and through the efforts of which Napoleon Bonaparte
intended to open a route to India, and thereby disturb,
if not annihilate, the British possessions in Asia.</p>

<p>After returning from Egypt, the services of this
valuable regiment were employed in guarding the
colonial possessions in the West Indies for a period
of twelve years, during which the British army acquired
additional honours and distinctions by its services in
the Peninsula, which terminated in 1814, and afterwards
by the decisive battle and overthrow of the
French army at Waterloo.</p>

<p>The <span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span> was employed on garrison duty
from 1821 to 1832 in the islands of the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>In 1837 the regiment was embarked for Ceylon, and in
1840 it formed part of the expedition to the Chinese seas,
and by its gallantry eventually compelled the government
of the "<em>Celestial empire</em>" to cede a portion of
territory to the British Crown, and to pay an indemnity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
for losses sustained: the word <em>China</em> and the device of
the <em>Dragon</em>, authorized by Her Majesty to be borne on
the colours and appointments of the regiment, are
proud memorials of its services in this distant scene of
warfare, which was a novel arena, not only to the
<span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span>, but to European troops generally. The
regiment was again employed during the military
operations on the Canton river in 1847, and towards
the close of that year proceeded to the East Indies.</p>

<p>After a service of twelve years in the eastern parts of
the world, the <span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH, ROYAL IRISH</span>, regiment has
received instructions to be prepared to return to its
native country, on being relieved by the <em>ninety-sixth</em>
regiment from the New South Wales Colony.</p>

<p>In drawing this summary, the compiler could not conclude
the record of the arduous services of so meritorious
a regiment, without an endeavour to do justice to
its loyalty and devotedness to ten successive sovereigns,
and to its zeal and usefulness in the cause of its country,
during a period of one hundred and sixty-five years.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 1st April, 1684.</em></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Arthur Forbes</span>, son of Sir Patrick Forbes, a Baronet of
Nova Scotia, was a cavalry officer in the Royal army during
the rebellion in the reign of King Charles I., and attained
the rank of Colonel in 1646. In 1651 he held a considerable
command in the north of Scotland, and after the defeat of
the Scots army at Worcester on the 3rd of September, 1651,
Colonel Forbes opposed the progress of the English under
General Monk, afterwards Duke of Albemarle, but was
eventually defeated, and fled to Ireland, where he was
permitted by Oliver Cromwell to possess his paternal estate.
He took an active part in bringing about the Restoration in
1660, and was appointed one of the commissioners of the
Court of Claims in Ireland: he was also nominated captain
of an independent troop of horse, and elected a member of
Parliament for Mullingar. He took an active part in preventing
the breaking out of a conspiracy against the government
in Ireland, in 1663; in 1670 he was sworn a member
of the Privy Council, and nominated Marshal of the army,&mdash;a
rank not continued in the service; and in 1671 he was
constituted one of the Lords Justices of Ireland. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
services were rewarded, in 1675, with the dignity of Baron
Clanehugh, and <span class="smcap">Viscount of Granard</span>; and in April,
1684, his Lordship was nominated Colonel of one of the
regiments, formed of independent companies in Ireland, at
that period, now the <span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span>, or the <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span>
regiment. In September following he was promoted to
the rank of Lieut.-General, and two months afterwards he was
advanced to the dignity of <span class="smcap">Earl of Granard</span>. In March,
1685, King James II. nominated the <span class="smcap">Earl of Granard</span>
one of the Lords Justices of the kingdom, and he was also
appointed Chairman of the Council; in 1686 his Lordship
resigned the colonelcy of the regiment in favour of his son,
Arthur Lord Forbes. Being pressed upon to proceed with
unusual severity against the Protestants, he wrote to the
King for permission to resign; but His Majesty wrote an
answer with his own hand, requesting him to continue in
office: he, however, advocated the cause of the Protestants
with so much warmth, that he was dismissed by King James
in March, 1689. The Earl of Granard attached himself
to the interests of King William III. He was sworn of the
Privy Council in December, 1690; and he commanded the
troops at the reduction of Sligo, in 1691.</p>

<p>The Earl of Granard built the Church of Castle-Forbes,
and established the linen manufactory at that place. He
died in 1694.</p>

colonelcy of the regiment which is now the <span class="fs70">EIGHTEENTH</span>, or
the <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span> regiment. He was a spirited young
nobleman, and succeeded in retaining more Protestants in
his regiment than were to be found in any other corps in the
army in Ireland. He joined the Prince of Orange at the
Revolution in 1688, when he withdrew from the service. He
succeeded to the dignity of <span class="smcap">Earl of Granard</span> on the

the royal parks in Ireland, and ranger of Phœnix Park, near
Dublin. He subsequently commanded a troop of cuirassiers;
but falling under the displeasure of the lord-lieutenant, the
Earl of Essex, he was removed from his appointments: he
was, however, restored to favour at a subsequent period. In
1684 he succeeded, on the death of his brother, to the
dignity of <span class="smcap">Earl of Meath</span>. He joined the Prince of
Orange at the Revolution of 1688, and in May, 1689, he was

chose to remain in that country in order to devote himself to its
interests, and withdrew from the army. He died in 1708.</p>

Lord Mountjoy's regiment. Being a zealous Protestant,
Captain Hamilton was deprived of his commission by Earl
Tyrconnel, and remained unemployed until the Revolution of
1688, when King William III. gave him a company in

in 1711; in 1712 he was rewarded with the colonelcy
of his regiment; he was also nominated Governor of the Royal
Hospital at Dublin. He concludes the journal of his numerous,
distinguished, and meritorious services in the following
words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In the month of May, 1717, the regiment received orders
to march to Portsmouth, and there I take my leave of them,
for, in the month of January following, His Majesty gave
me leave to resign my regiment to Colonel William Cosby,
after having served six crowned heads of England, and been
forty years attached to one company without ever being
removed from it; having made twenty-one campaigns;
having been in seven field-battles&mdash;fifteen sieges&mdash;seven
grand attacks on counterscarps and breaches&mdash;two remarkable
retreats&mdash;at the passing of four of the enemy's lines&mdash;besides
several other petty actions; and, through
God's assistance, never had one drop of blood drawn from
me in all those actions. After I had disposed of my
regiment, I went to my government in Ireland." Brigadier-General
Stearne died on the 1st of November, 1732.</p>

Atholl Highlanders, in which corps he rose to the rank of
Lieut.-Colonel in 1783; but his regiment was disbanded soon
after the termination of the American war. Having previously
studied tactics at Strasburg, he again visited the
Continent, and acquired additional information on military
subjects. Soon after the commencement of the French revolutionary
war he returned to the United Kingdom; was promoted
to the rank of Colonel on the 1st of March, 1794; and,
taking great interest in raising the ninety-fourth regiment,
he was appointed Colonel of that corps in October. He

1799, and honourable mention is made of his gallant conduct
in the public despatches. Having given proof of his capabilities
as a General officer, he was nominated second in
command in the expedition to Egypt, under Lieut.-General
Sir Ralph Abercromby; and after the death of that officer,
from wounds received in the action of the 21st of March, the
command of the troops devolved on Major-General Hutchinson,
who found himself suddenly placed at the head of the
army under circumstances of a peculiarly difficult character.
In the subsequent operations in Egypt he evinced talent and
energy, sustaining the honour of his Sovereign, promoting
the glory of his country, and forcing the French "Army
of the East" to evacuate Egypt. For his services in this
enterprise he twice received the thanks of both Houses of
Parliament; he gained the approbation of his Sovereign, was
nominated a Knight of the Bath, received the Order of the
Crescent from the Grand Seignior, was elevated to the peerage
by the title of <span class="smcap">Baron Hutchinson of Alexandria</span> and of
Knocklofty in the county of Tipperary, and received an
important addition to his income: he was also nominated
Governor of Stirling Castle. In 1803 his Lordship was promoted
to the rank of Lieut.-General.</p>

<p>The subsequent services of Lord Hutchinson were of a diplomatic
character: in November, 1806, he proceeded on an
extraordinary mission to the Prussian and Russian armies; and
he afterwards proceeded to the court of St. Petersburg. In
1806 he was nominated to the colonelcy of the fifty-seventh
regiment, and was removed, in 1811, to the <span class="fs70">ROYAL IRISH</span>

<p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> This regiment has furnished several historians of its early services.
The first is General Richard Stearne, who was nominated
ensign of one of the independent companies in 1678, and colonel of
the regiment in 1712: his narrative comprises a period of forty-one
years,&mdash;viz. from 1678 to 1719, and is continued by an officer of
the regiment to 1759: this work is in manuscript. The journal of
Captain Parker, who entered the regiment as private in 1689, rose
to the rank of captain, and retired in 1718, embraces the services of
the regiment during that period, and was afterwards published by
his son. General Richard Kane, who was many years an officer of
the regiment, gives an account of its services, in the wars of King
William III. and of Queen Anne, in a work on military discipline.
Private Millner also published a journal of the campaigns from 1701
to 1712. No other regiment has produced so many historians of
its services.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_13_13" id="Footnote_13_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> The Baron De Ghinkel was born in Guelderland: he commenced
his military career in early life, and obtained the Order of the
Elephant from the Prince of Orange for services in Flanders.
He accompanied King William III to Ireland in 1690, and served
under Marshal Duke Schomberg, and afterwards under Count Solms:
he was appointed to succeed the latter in the chief command of the
army in Ireland, and after the termination of the war in 1691, his
Majesty conferred on him the honor of the Irish peerage with the title
of <em>Earl of Athlone</em> and <em>Viscount Aghrim</em>: he died at Utrecht in 1705.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_14_14" id="Footnote_14_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> The rank of the several regiments of the British Army was
first regulated by a Board of General Officers assembled in the
Netherlands, by command of King William III., on the 10th
June, 1694.
</p>
<p>
Another Board of General Officers was assembled by order of
Queen Anne in 1713, to decide on the rank and precedence of
regiments raised subsequently to 1694.
</p>
<p>
A third Board was assembled, by command of King George I., in
1715, for the same purpose.
</p>
<p>
These Boards recommended that English regiments, raised in
England, should take rank from the dates of their formation; and
that English, Scots, and Irish regiments, raised for the service of a
foreign power, should take rank from the dates of their being placed
on the English establishment.
</p>
<p>
The numerical titles of regiments, as fixed on the principle laid
down in the reports of the Boards of General Officers, above alluded
to, were confirmed by the warrant issued by authority of King
George II., dated 1st July, 1751,&mdash;and also by the warrant of King
George III., dated 19th December, 1768.</p></div>

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
